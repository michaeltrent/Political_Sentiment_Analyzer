      "features:b'PHILADELPHIA \\\\- It was fine.\\nThe DNC\\'s Tuesday agenda featured exactly one major primetime headliner: Former President Bill Clinton, who set out to build an emotionally-rooted case on behalf of his wife, whom their party had nominated for the presidency hours earlier. In 2012, I remember sitting in the arena rafters in Charlotte, watching with helpless frustration and dismay as our 42nd president articulated the most compelling (if fact-challenged) argument for Barack Obama\\'s re-election that I\\'d seen to date. He was masterful, weaving a plausible-sounding story in which Republicans were ridiculed as howling partisans, blinded by resentful and unrealistic expectations of his tale\\'s heroic protagonist. He went full policy wonk at times, somehow pulling it off. He made people believe that Obama and company were the adults trying to fix awful inherited problems, while the GOP shrieked in nihilistic protest. I recall the sinking, intuitive feeling that the race -- which was absolutely losable for Obama at that point -- had shifted with one speech. I awarded him a B+ in my postgame analysis, which was wishful thinking. The thrust of Clinton\\'s argument went largely unrefuted for weeks, with the glorious and fleeting exception of that first presidential debate in Denver. Bill Clinton really did help Obama win. Period. And Romney knew it, as evidenced by this memorable one-liner from his pre-election Alfred E. Smith dinner comedy routine. The best jokes have at least a kernel of truth to them:\\n> \"Campaigns can be grueling, exhausting. President Obama and I are each very lucky to have one person who is always in our corner, someone who we can lean on, and someone who is a comforting presence, without whom we wouldn\\'t be able to go another day. I have my beautiful wife, Ann; he has Bill Clinton.\"\\nTonight, Bill Clinton strode into the spotlight once again, this time to work his magic on behalf of his wife. He did well, I think, but didn\\'t alter the trajectory of the race. That\\'s not to say that Hillary won\\'t get a boost out of Philadelphia; she very probably will, as Trump did after Cleveland. But that was not a lightning strike address. It wasn\\'t even the best speech of the first half of the convention. Still, it was pretty clear what he was trying to do. Before the big address, Megyn Kelly asked me if I thought Bill would seek to rescue Hillary\\'s drowning honesty numbers, which are deservedly and truly awful. My reply:\\n> .@guypbenson: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c...can [@billclinton] do anything to help rehabilitate her trustworthiness numbers? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think he can.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d #KellyFile\\n> \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) July 27, 2016\\nHe didn\\'t really even try. Instead, he set to work chipping away at her personal favorability gap, which is also a serious problem:\\n> Reality check: Hillary Clinton\\'s unfavorable ratings -- CNN 55%, Gallup 57%, CBS 56%.\\n> \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Stuart Rothenberg (@StuPolitics) July 27, 2016\\nClinton painted a portrait of a technocratic workhorse (committees! task forces!) who genuinely cares about people, and has channeled those sentiments into a lifetime of tireless public service. That was the whole point of his at times meandering reminiscences about their early life together. And putting a human face on a woman seen by many as power-hungry and calculating is precisely why he devoted quite a lot of time to describing Hillary as a mother. (I don\\'t think talking about Hillary\\'s water breaking was simply tossed in casually). Along the same lines, Chelsea will undoubtedly lay the \"grandma\" color on thick on Thursday night. The former president traced his timeline up into the present day -- skipping certain unhelpful bits, like the year 1998 -- and adorning Hillary\\'s tenure at the State Department with the most impressive-sounding \"achievement\" language he could summon. His only partisan shots were a brief jab about mocking the disabled, and the suggestion that everything at the RNC last week was \"made up.\" In fairness, he is something of an expert on the subject of making things up. He didn\\'t need to go uber-partisan, as he did four years ago, because his objectives were different this time. Bill Clinton can read a poll as well as anyone else; he knows that most people already dislike Donald Trump. This was about boosting Hillary\\'s very slight and narrowing favorability advantage, not trying to drive Trump\\'s stratospheric unfavorability numbers any higher. His wife, he said, is serious and committed. The real deal. Believe him, he\\'s witnessed it for decades firsthand.\\nRecommended\\nWhy Is There a War on Cheerleaders?\\nDennis Prager\\nWas the speech welcomed rapturously in the hall? Yes. They love him here. Did it play well on television? I bet it did. It helped her. Was it a game-changing performance that\\'s likely to permanently alter people\\'s perceptions of Hillary Clinton? I doubt it. She is still the same flawed, unlikable, dishonest, ethically-unfit candidate she was this morning. And if rumors and vows are to be believed, more embarrassments and ethical imbroglios may lie ahead for her. Bill Clinton hasn\\'t lost his touch as a marvelous political communicator, but there\\'s only so much he could work with here. His effort was admirable and solid nonetheless. But I suspect it didn\\'t deliver the memorable political juice that his 2012 outing did.\\nOnward, to day three.' target:1\n",
      "features:b'The second suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings was taken into custody Friday night, bringing to an end a massive manhunt in the tense Massachusetts capital worried by warnings the man was possibly armed with explosives.\\nAfter announcing the arrest on Twitter, Boston police tweeted: \"CAPTURED!!! The hunt is over. The search is done. The terror is over. And justice has won. Suspect in custody.\"\\nAuthorities confirmed the man in custody is 19-year-old Dzhokar Tsarnaev, who escaped an overnight shootout with police that left his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev -- the other man wanted in the bombings -- dead.\\nThe younger Tsarnaev was in serious condition, Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said at a news conference. He was being treated at Boston\\'s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, hospital spokeswoman Kelly Lawman said.\\nTsarnaev was cornered late Friday as he was hiding on a boat in a backyard of Watertown, a suburb of Boston.\\nPolice were alerted to his whereabouts by a man who went outside after authorities lifted an order for residents to stay inside during the manhunt. The resident saw blood on a boat in the backyard, Davis said. He then lifted up the tarp covering the boat and \"saw a man covered with blood,\" he said.\\nIt was that call that resulted in an arrest less than a week after two bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, shocking the nation and leaving a city on edge.\\n\"There was an exchange of gunfire, and I don\\'t know if he was struck,\" Davis said of the suspect.\\nAuthorities, using a bullhorn, had called on the suspect to surrender: \"Come out with your hands up.\"\\nTsarnaev, according to authorities, refused to surrender.\\n\"We used a robot to pull the tarp off the boat,\" David Procopio of the Massachusetts State Police said. \"We were also watching him with a thermal imaging camera in our helicopter. He was weakened by blood loss -- injured last night most likely,\"\\nTsarnaev was taken into custody after authorities rushed the boat, Davis said.\\nClosing a chapter\\nThe standoff and subsequent arrest came just minutes after authorities indicated during a news conference that a manhunt for the suspect appeared to come up empty.\\nAuthorities had cast a wide net for the suspect, virtually shutting down Boston and its surroundings after a violent night in which authorities say the brothers allegedly hurled explosives at pursuers, after killing Massachusetts Institute of Technology police Officer Sean Collier and hijacking a car.\\n\"We\\'ve closed an important chapter in this tragedy,\" President Barack Obama said in a televised address. Even so, he vowed to seek answers to the motive in the attack and find out whether the suspects received any help to carry out their plot.\\nThe government is invoking the public safety exception to question Tsarnaev, meaning in cases of national security a person can be questioned without being read their Miranda rights, a Justice Department official told CNN on condition of anonymity. The official is not authorized to publicly discuss the matter.\\nU.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz told reporters the \"government has that opportunity right now\" to invoke the public safety exemption but stopped short of declaring it would take that step, saying only the suspect was in the hospital.\\nRepublican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham called for Tsarnaev to be held as an enemy combatant.\\n\\'Glad it\\'s over\\'\\nWord of the arrest spread quickly in suburban Watertown, where residents took to the streets to cheer the news that suspect had been arrested.\\n\"Thank you. Thank you. It was our pleasure,\" members of the Boston SWAT team said over a loudspeaker.\\nMary Sullivan was walking her black Labrador earlier Friday night when gunshots rang out in her neighborhood.\\n\"I\\'m glad it\\'s over,\" she said. \"The city and the people have gone through so much pain over these irrational decisions of these young men.\"\\nBombing connection\\nThe manhunt began late Thursday just hours after the FBI released photos of the two suspects in the marathon bombings.\\n\"Investigators are recovering a significant amount of homemade explosives\" from the scene of the shootout, Procopio told CNN.\\nIt was not immediately clear what explosives were recovered, but the discovery followed a tense night in which authorities say the brothers allegedly hurled a homemade grenade and five pipe bombs at pursuers after killing an officer and hijacking a car.\\nTamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was wearing explosives and a triggering device when he died, a source briefed on the investigation told CNN on condition of anonymity.\\nThe manhunt brought Boston to a near standstill. The Boston Red Sox announced they were postponing Friday night\\'s game against the Kansas City Royals \"to support efforts of law enforcement officers.\" NHL\\'s Boston Bruins also postponed its game against the Pittsburgh Penguins.\\nThe city\\'s subway, bus, Amtrak train and Greyhound and regional Bolt Bus services were shut down. Taxi service across the city also was suspended for a time during the manhunt. Every Boston area school was closed.\\nBoston\\'s public transit authority sent city buses to Watertown to evacuate residents while bomb experts combed the surroundings for possible explosives.\\nInitially, authorities said the brothers started their rampage by robbing a convenience store. By late Friday, the Middlesex District Attorney\\'s office backtracked on the allegation, saying an investigation determined that the robbery at a 7-Eleven was unrelated.\\nOfficer killed\\nThe violent hours leading up to the capture began in Cambridge, across the Charles River from Boston, MIT officer Collier was shot and killed while he sat in his car on Thursday night, the Suffolk County District Attorney\\'s Office said in a statement.\\nThe two suspects, according to authorities, then hijacked a vehicle at gunpoint in Cambridge, telling the driver that they were the marathon bombers, a law enforcement source told CNN.\\nAt some point, apparently at a gas station, that source said, the driver escaped.\\nPolice, who were tracking the vehicle using its built-in GPS system, picked up the chase in Watertown. The pursuit went into a residential neighborhood, with the suspects throwing explosives at police.\\nA shootout erupted and ultimately one bomber -- later identified as Tamerlan Tsarnaev -- got out of the car. Police shot him, and his brother ran over him as he drove away, according to the law enforcement source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\\nRichard H. Donohue Jr., 33, a three-year veteran of the transit system police force, was shot and wounded in the incident and taken to a hospital, a transit police spokesman said Friday. The officer\\'s condition was not immediately known.\\nAnother 15 police officers were treated for minor injuries sustained during the explosions and shootout, Jennifer Kovalich, a spokeswoman for St. Elizabeth\\'s Medical Center, said.\\nSuspects background\\nPolice believe the brothers are the same men pictured in images released Thursday by the FBI as suspects in the marathon bombing that killed three people and wounded dozens on Monday.\\nAt least 58 people remained hospitalized, including three in critical condition, according to a CNN count.\\nThe men are shown in the images walking together near the marathon finish line.\\nThe first suspect -- apparently Tamerlan Tsarnaev, according to authorities -- appears in the images wearing a dark hat, sunglasses and a backpack. The second suspect, wearing a white cap, police said, is the one who remained at large throughout Friday until he was taken into custody Friday night.\\nBut the mother of the Tsarnaev brothers refused to believe they were involved in the marathon bombings and subsequent shootout.\\n\"It\\'s impossible for them to do such things. I am really telling you that this is a setup,\" Zubeidat Tsarnaeva told state-run Russia Today from Dagestan.\\n\"My son would never keep it in secret. ...If there is anyone who would know it would be me. He wouldn\\'t hide it. But there was never a word.\"\\nThe brothers came from the Russian Caucasus region and moved to Kazakhstan at a young age before coming to the United States several years ago.\\n\"My youngest was raised from 8 years in America. My oldest was really properly raised in our house. Nobody talked about terrorism,\" their mother said.\\nThe suspects\\' parents recently returned to Dagestan in the Caucasus region after living in the United States for about 10 years because they were \"nostalgic,\" the father, Anzor Tsarnaev, told Russian state-run Zvezda TV.\\nHe accused someone of framing his sons. \"I don\\'t know who exactly did it. But someone did.\"\\nA federal official told CNN that Dzhokar Tsarnaev came to the U.S. as a tourist with his family in the early 2000s and later asked for asylum. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2012. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was not a naturalized citizen, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He came \"a few years later\" and was lawfully in the United States as a green-card holder.\\nTamerlan Tsarnaev had studied at Bunker Hill Community College and wanted to become an engineer, according to those who knew him. He then took a year off to train as a boxer.\\n\\'I don\\'t understand them\\'\\nThe official said that a posting on a social media site in the elder brother\\'s name included the comments: \"I don\\'t have a single American friend. I don\\'t understand them.\"\\nDzhokar Tsarnaev attended Cambridge Rindge & Latin, a public high school, said Eric Mercado, who graduated a year behind the suspect. Mercado said Tsarnaev had worked at Harvard University as a lifeguard.\\n\"We hung out; we partied; we were good high school friends,\" Mercado told CNN.\\n\"We\\'re all, like, in shock. We don\\'t really understand. There were no telltale signs of any kind of malicious behavior from Dzhokar. It\\'s all coming as a shock, really.\"\\nMercado said he lived a block away from the suspect and did not know his older brother.\\nDzhokar Tsarnaev is currently registered as a student at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, which ordered its campus evacuated on Friday. The school is located 65 miles south of Cambridge, just west of New Bedford.\\nLarry Aaronson, Dzhokar Tsarnaev\\'s neighbor and a former teacher at the high school Tsarnaev attended, called him a \"wonderful kid.\"\\n\"He was so grateful to be here, he was compassionate, he was caring, he was jovial,\" Aaronson told CNN.' target:-1\n",

      "features:b'WASHINGTON \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Nothing has done more to fuel the national debate over police tactics than the dramatic, sometimes grisly videos: A man gasping \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t breathe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d through a police chokehold on Staten Island, a 12-year-old boy shot dead in a park in Cleveland. And now, perhaps the starkest video yet, showing a South Carolina police officer shooting a fleeing man in the back.\\nThe videos have spurred calls from statehouses to the White House for more officers to attach cameras to their uniforms. While cameras frequently exonerate officers in shootings, the recent spate of videos has raised uncomfortable questions about how much the American criminal justice system can rely on the accounts of police officers when the cameras are not rolling.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEveryone in this business knows that cops have been given the benefit of the doubt,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Hugh F. Keefe, a Connecticut lawyer who has defended several police officers accused of misconduct. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re always assumed to be telling the truth, unless there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tangible evidence otherwise.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn the fatal shooting in South Carolina, the most compelling evidence, provided by a bystander with a camera phone, was shaky and at times unfocused. But the video clearly showed the officer, Michael T. Slager, firing eight times as Walter L. Scott, 50, tried to flee after a traffic stop. The officer had said that he fired amid a scuffle, when Mr. Scott seized his stun gun and the officer feared for his safety.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWithout the video, we wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what we know,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Matthew R. Rabon, a college student who joined a demonstration on Wednesday outside City Hall in North Charleston, S.C., where Officer Slager now faces a murder charge. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd what we know here is really significant: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the difference between an officer doing his job and an officer killing a man in cold blood.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMany cities have installed cameras in their police cruisers for years, and some \\xe2\\x80\\x94 an estimated 25 percent of departments that responded to a 2013 survey \\xe2\\x80\\x94 require so-called body cameras. Those numbers are dwarfed by the millions of Americans who carry camera-equipped cellphones. As cameras become ubiquitous, the digital video is likely to become a go-to source of impartial evidence in much the same way that DNA did in the 1990s.\\nVideo evidence is not new, of course; the tape of officers beating Rodney King in 1991 helped ignite the Los Angeles riots after the officers were acquitted. When departments began installing dashboard cameras in the 1990s, many officers opposed it. But they quickly concluded that the recordings often cleared them of wrongdoing after citizen complaints. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor the most part, unless you are behaving badly, those things are going to back you up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said David Harris, a University of Pittsburgh law professor who studies police practices.\\nMany officers similarly opposed efforts to videotape confessions, but that resistance has been fading in recent years. Police organizations have endorsed the practice, and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. recently required the F.B.I. to start taping interviews.\\nBut cellphone videos taken by bystanders tend to make many police officers uncomfortable, because they have no control over the setting and often are not even aware they are being filmed until later. Though the courts have held that people have a constitutional right to record the police, those who do are frequently challenged by officers.\\nWhile investigating the Police Department in Ferguson, Mo., after a deadly police shooting last summer, the Justice Department found that officers there were enraged to discover people taping them.\\nAs an example, a Justice Department report cited a traffic stop in which a Ferguson officer told the driver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 16-year-old son not to videotape him. The confrontation escalated, the officer wrestled the phone away from the teenager, and everyone in the car was arrested \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunder disputed circumstances that could have been clarified by a video recording,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the report said.\\nCellphone videos have captured police officers pushing and slapping a homeless man in Florida and shooting a man who threw rocks at officers in Washington State. In February, two Pelham, N.Y., officers retired after a video contradicted their account of an arrest of a black man.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe ability to record has gotten so prevalent that police can no longer count on their account to be the truth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Harris, the Pittsburgh professor, said.\\nThe increase in cellphone cameras is one reason many police unions do not oppose requirements that officers carry body cameras, said Chuck Wexler, the head of the Police Executive Research Forum in Washington. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe big push for body cameras has been driven in part by the sense that citizens have their phones and can record, and it was only part of the whole story,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are very used to being videotaped,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lt. Mark Wood, the executive officer in the operations division of the Indianapolis Police Department, where the department is testing body cameras. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are under the impression that we are always being videotaped, because we probably are.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nData is still spotty, but an early study in Rialto, Calif., suggests that when officers carry body cameras, they are less likely to use force. Similar studies in Mesa, Ariz., and in Britain showed that citizen complaints also decreased.\\nNorth Charleston, a city of about 100,000 people, has ordered about 100 body cameras, but its officers are not yet using them. Mayor R. Keith Summey said Wednesday that he had ordered 150 more \\xe2\\x80\\x9cso that every officer that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on the street in uniform will have a body camera.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMarlon E. Kimpson, a South Carolina state senator who represents North Charleston and helped push for financing for the cameras, said he hoped they would help calm tensions between residents and officers. He said he believed a body camera would have prevented Saturday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shooting. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe the officer would have behaved the way he did had he been wearing a body camera,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nEven without the video, it is likely that other forensic evidence would have raised questions about Officer Slager\\xe2\\x80\\x99s account. The coroner found that Mr. Scott was shot several times in the back, and forensic examiners can typically tell whether someone was shot at close range in a scuffle or from a distance. Nevertheless, the dramatic video pushed the shooting into the national spotlight. Eddie Driggers, the North Charleston police chief, told reporters Wednesday that he was sickened by the video.\\nChris Fialko, a criminal defense lawyer in Charlotte, N.C., said that while the ubiquity of video had changed the dynamic between the police and citizens, jurors still viewed police officers as credible, even when faced with incriminating video.\\nMr. Fialko said he once represented an officer in a case where a dashboard camera had captured the officer slamming a man, who appeared to offer no resistance, to the ground. The officer testified in his own defense.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVideo can lie,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Fialko recalled saying in his closing argument. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe cop is the one out there, hearing what the guy is saying and smelling the guy and seeing his sweat, and he is acting based on years of experience.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe jury, Mr. Fialko said, acquitted the officer.' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'Steve Harrigan reports from Vero Beach, Florida\\nHurricane Matthew closed in on Florida Thursday evening as a powerful Category 4 storm as the governor urged people up and down the state&aposs 580-mile Atlantic coastline to brace for \"devastating impacts.\"\\n\"This storm is a monster,\" Gov. Rick Scott said at an evening news conference. \"Matthew is likely to produce devastating impacts along portions of the east coast tonight,\" he added.\\nAs it moved north in the evening, Matthew stayed about 100 miles or more off South Florida, sparing the 4.4 million people in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas from its most punishing effects.\\n\"We were lucky this time,\" Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said.\\nBy Thursday night, more than 60,000 homes and businesses were without power. Streets in Vero Beach were partially covered with water, and hotel guests in Orlando were told to stay inside, though a few sneaked out to smoke or watch the rain.\\nThe hurricane was instead expected to blow ashore -- or come dangerously close to doing so -- early Friday north of West Palm Beach, which has about 1.1 million people, and then slowly push north for the next 12 hours along the Interstate 95 corridor, through Cape Canaveral and Jacksonville, according to the National Hurricane Center.\\nForecasters said it would then probably hug the coast of Georgia and South Carolina over the weekend before veering out to sea -- perhaps even looping back toward Florida in the middle of next week as a tropical storm.\\nAs of 10 p.m. EDT, Matthew was located 65 miles east-southeast of West Palm Beach, moving northwest at about 13 mph.\\nAs evening fell, the winds picked up along Vero Beach, midway between West Palm Beach and Cape Canaveral, stripping away palm fronds, ripping awnings and blowing sand that stung the face. Waves crashed on the beach, and rain came in short bursts. About 30,000 homes and businesses were in the dark.\\nHurricane damage in Les Cayes, Haiti. (Margaret Traub/International Medical Corps)\\nOfficials from Florida to South Carolina urged an estimated 2 million people to evacuate. Scott said so far he has activated 3,500 Florida National Guard members to assist in any rescues and recovery missions after the storm passed.\\nCLICK FOR INFORMATION ON CURRENT FLORIDA EVACUATION ORDERS\\nPresident Obama declared a state of emergency for Florida and South Carolina on Thursday, clearing the way for federal aid in addition to state and local emergency response teams. The Pentagon reported the governors of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina had mobilized 4,500 National Guardsmen ahead of the hurricane.\\nForecasters said Matthew could dump up to 15 inches of rain in some spots and cause a storm surge of 9 feet or more.\\nThey said the major threat to the Southeast would not be the winds -- which newer buildings can withstand -- but the massive surge of seawater that could wash over coastal communities along a 500-mile stretch from South Florida to the Charleston, S.C., area.\\nThe Fort Lauderdale airport shut down on Thursday morning, and further north the Orlando airport also closed. By early-evening, flight-tracking service FlightAware.com reported that nearly 1,500 flights within the U.S. had been scrapped, with the largest numbers at Fort Lauderdale and Miami. American Airlines, which has a major hub in Miami, was the hardest-hit carrier, followed by Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways.\\nAmtrak suspended train service between Miami and New York, and cruise lines rerouted ships to avoid the storm, which in some cases will mean more days at sea.\\nWorkers transferred patients from two Florida waterfront hospitals and a nursing home near Daytona Beach to safer locations. Officials at Walt Disney World, Universal Studios and SeaWorld said the parks would shut down Thursday afternoon until the storm passes.\\nThousands of people hunkered down in schools converted to shelters, and inland hotels in places such as Charlotte, N.C., reported brisk business.\\nAt the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, NASA no longer has to worry about rolling space shuttles back from the launch pad to the hangar because of hurricanes, since the shuttle fleet is now retired. But the spaceflight company SpaceX was concerned about the storm&aposs effect on its leased seaside pad.\\n\"When a hurricane is forecast to take a track roughly parallel to a coastline, as Matthew is forecast to do from Florida through South Carolina, it becomes very difficult to specify impacts at any one location,\" National Hurricane Center forecaster Lixion Avila said.\\nThe number of people killed in Haiti rose to at least 283, local officials told Reuters on Thursday, saying the storm killed at least four people elsewhere in the Caribbean.\\nGeorgia Gov. Nathan Deal ordered an evacuation of the state&aposs entire coast, covering more than a half-million people. It was the first hurricane evacuation along the Georgia coast since 1999, when the state narrowly escaped Floyd.\\nThe last Category 3 storm or higher to hit the U.S. was Wilma in October 2005. It sliced across Florida with 120 mph winds, killing five people and causing an estimated $21 billion in damage.\\nAs people hurried to higher ground, authorities in South Carolina said a motorist died on Wednesday after being shot by deputies in a gun battle that erupted when he sped away from a checkpoint along an evacuation route.\\nSouth Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley reversed Interstate 26 so that all lanes of traffic were headed west and out of Charleston. It was the first time the lanes had been reversed. Plans to reverse the lanes were put in place after hours-long traffic jams during Hurricane Floyd in 1999.\\nHaley said Thursday night she&aposs \"begging\" people to understand the seriousness of Matthew and evacuate the South Carolina coast.\\nHaley said so far 280,000 people had evacuated as of 3 p.m. Thursday, but that means hundreds of thousands more need to leave.\\nThe governor told reporters that forecasts are getting worse, but \"we can&apost take you by the hand and bring you to the Upstate.\"\\nMedical facilities that have had to evacuate their patients include Beaufort Memorial Hospital. Haley said Thursday night that should be an indication of the seriousness.\\nAuthorities said the storm surge in some areas along the southern coast of South Carolina will exceed those when Hurricane Hugo hit the state in 1989. Haley said to \"imagine floor-to-ceiling\" storm surges, while eastern parts of the state could see 8 to 14 inches of rain.\\nIn Florida, Scott also lifted tolls on major roads. The Florida Turnpike, Alligator Alley and part of the Central Florida Expressway Authority and the Miami-Dade Expressway Authority had toll services suspended, according to Fox 35 Orlando.\\nIn Melbourne Beach, near the Kennedy Space Center, Carlos and April Medina moved their paddle board and kayak inside the garage and took pictures off the walls of their home about 500 feet from the coast. They moved the pool furniture inside, turned off the water, disconnected all electrical appliances and emptied their refrigerator.\\nThey then hopped in a truck filled with legal documents, jewelry and a decorative carved shell that had once belonged to April Medina&aposs great-grandfather and headed west to Orlando, where they planned to ride out the storm with their daughter&aposs family.\\n\"The way we see it, if it maintains its current path, we get tropical storm-strength winds. If it makes a little shift to the left, it could be a Category 2 or 3 and I don&apost want to be anywhere near it,\" Carlos Medina said. \"We are just being a little safe, a little bit more cautious.\"\\nAbout 20 miles away in the town of Cape Canaveral, John Long said Hurricane Matthew is just hype as his neighbors in his RV park packed up and evacuated inland. Even though his 32-foot RV is just feet from the Banana River and a half mile from the beach, he had no plans to leave.\\nLong, who owns a bike shop and has lived along the Space Coast for 30 years, said he has a generator and enough food and water for himself and his cats to last a week. \"There&aposs always tremendous buildup and then it&aposs no stronger than an afternoon thunderstorm,\" he said. \"I&aposm not anticipating that much damage.\"\\nAt Folly Beach, S.C., southwest of Charleston, Gaby Trompeter loaded her car at her beachfront home preparing to evacuate to Augusta, Georgia.\\nTrompeter, a 50-year-old goldsmith who designs and makes jewelry, remembers Hurricane Hugo when she stayed in Savannah, Georgia, in 1989.\\nA year ago when what has been described as a 1,000-year flood inundated South Carolina there was so much water on the road near her house she couldn&apost get out for three days.\\n\"If it brings a lot of rain, more than the storm last year, why would I want to stay?\" she said.\\nOn the Georgia coast, 92-year-old Lou Arcangeli saw two of his adult children come to his home on Tybee Island to help prepare and evacuate if necessary.\\n\"It&aposs serious,\" said Arcangeli, who has lived in the Savannah area since 1979, when Hurricane David became the last hurricane to make landfall on Georgia&aposs 100-mile coast. \"I&aposm going to keep an eye on it and not wait until the last minute. As far as I&aposm concerned, what&aposs going to happen is going to happen.\"\\n\"We have a house that sits right here on the water and we kind of said goodbye to it thinking that, you know, the house ... might not be here when we get back,\" said Jennifer Banker, a resident of Georgia&aposs dangerously exposed St. Simons Island. \"You know, we pray a lot and trust God to provide.\"\\nSome coastal residents in Georgia and beyond decided to take their chances and stay.\\nDarcy O&aposConnor, a restaurant owner who lives in a rowhouse in Savannah, Ga., a historic city of many beautifully maintained homes from the 18th and 19th century, said she and her most of her neighbors were sticking around.\\nO&aposConnor noted that her home, built in 1883, has weathered hurricanes before: \"Half the windows, if you look, still have the original glass.

      "features:b'America woke up without another one of the most recognizable faces in morning television Wednesday, as the rapid-fire sexual harassment allegations that have been rocking Hollywood and Washington brought down one of the most prominent figures to date.\\nA visibly shaken Savannah Guthrie announced at the top of the Today show that her former co-anchor Matt Lauer had been fired, the second major morning show host to lose his position in the wake of harassment accusations in a little more than a week. The news plunged the morning talk-show landscape into turmoil, and raises further questions about how far these questions of sexual harassment will go and who will be the next to fall.\\nHours after the announcement, Garrison Keillor, the radio host whose name is nearly synonymous with A Prairie Home Companion, joined Lauer on the list of high-profile men accused of sexual harassment and assault claims and summarily dismissed, including Lauer\\'s CBS morning show counterpart Charlie Rose.\\nMore: Charlie Rose scandal: PBS, CBS suspend journalist after sexual-misconduct allegations\\nMore: Replacing Matt Lauer: Is the era of the big-name TV news anchor over?\\nThe rapid fire nature of these allegations has signaled a shift in the zeitgeist, as once-tolerated and shrugged-off behavior has become the undoing of previously untouchable men. But Lauer\\'s case is one of the most high-profile so far, and may be particularly problematic for NBC. The Today show, which is NBC\\'s crown jewel but ranks behind ABC\\'s Good Morning America, rakes in nearly $500 million a year in ad revenue. Lauer has been the face of the program for more than 20 years.\\nIt also raises questions similar to those faced by the embattled Weinstein Co. about who knew what when. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s another black eye for NBC News leadership, headed by chairman Andrew Lack, a close friend of Lauer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. The network had passed on Ronan Farrow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s explosive New Yorker piece detailing chilling allegations of rape and sexual assault against producer Harvey Weinstein that published in October and helped jumpstart the torrent of allegations over the last two months.\\nEarlier this month, NBC News also fired former senior vice president for booking Matt Zimmerman after learning multiple women had accused him of inappropriate conduct. Zimmerman was a booker for Today and close with Lauer.\\nLauer, 59, has been a part of many viewers\\' mornings since being named co-anchor of NBC\\'s morning news program in 1997, covering everything from the Olympics to interviews with presidents.\\nThat scope, and the tidal wave of harassment allegations against high-powered men in the Weinstein fallout, may put more of a focus on Lauer and others, according to Jonathan Klein, a former U.S. president of CNN.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPartly, I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re seeing the fact that media companies are covering sexual harassment accusations so frequently now that they have to maintain their credibility internally,\" Klein said. News executives can\\'t fairly report on accusations while overlooking their own companies\\' transgressions, he said.\\nClips of Lauer interviewing accused harassers and victims resurfaced online Wednesday, including a 2012 Today show parody that made light of sexual harassment.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t define a legacy in one day, but this is part of his biography, part of his career, (as it is) with so many others, too.

First he confounded his own party by supporting a full range of gun control measures, calling for legislation by Congress and suggesting he might issue an executive order banning bump stock enhancements. In the process he enraged the NRA as Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Amy Klobuchar smiled.\\nBy the end of the week he was praised by union leaders for establishing huge tariffs on steel, a move that Wall Street investors hated.\\nAt the same time, he lost his fourth communications director and 20th senior White House official, watched as his son-in-law got his wings clipped, witnessed his chief of staff exert more influence, and saw his former campaign manager Paul Manafort indicted again for Russian-related money-laundering.\\nREST IN PEACE BILLY GRAHAM! pic.twitter.com/2qMoUccVC2\\nHe again sparred with his own attorney general, this time an especially nasty spectacle.

And then he attacked Attorney General Jeff Sessions yet again and started a trade war.\\nJed Babbin\\nThe president continued to demand fast action on legislation related to gun control. In addition to the things he proposed last week, Trump wants to raise the age for legal purchase of rifles to 21 and also said that guns should be confiscated from mentally disturbed people before they were allowed due process on the decision to confiscate. In one meeting with several senators, he chastised the pols, saying they were scared of the National Rifle Association.\\nThe courts were uneven in giving the president one big win and one equally big loss this week. First, a California federal court ruled that the construction of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s border wall could proceed despite environmentalists\\xe2\\x80\\x99 objections because the president has the power to waive environmental laws in such cases.

      "features:b'Rep. Ryan, Sen. Murray speak out\\nCongressional negotiators on Tuesday announced a tentative budget deal that would avoid a partial government shutdown, but also begin to unravel hard-fought spending cuts.\\nThe lead negotiators -- Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Wash., and House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- detailed the specifics of the proposal at an evening press conference.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m proud of this agreement,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ryan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt reduces the deficit\\xe2\\x80\\x94without raising taxes. And it cuts spending in a smarter way. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a firm step in the right direction, and I ask all my colleagues in the House to support it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut the measure could face a tough climb, particularly in the House which is expected to take up the bill first. Ahead of Tuesday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s announcement, fiscal conservatives raised alarm that lawmakers were proposing to roll back sequester cuts.\\nThe proposal would restore about $63 billion in funding that had been cut by the so-called sequester. Officials said the increases would be offset by a variety of spending reductions and increased fees elsewhere in the budget totaling about $85 billion over a decade, leaving enough for a largely symbolic deficit cut of $23 billion over the next decade.\\nHowever, fiscal conservatives warned that lawmakers were simply trading increased spending now for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpromises\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of cuts sometime in the future.\\nWhile Ryan predicted that conservatives would support the bill and GOP leaders praised the negotiators, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., came out against it.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the short run, this budget also cancels earlier spending reductions, instead of making some tough decisions about how to tackle our long-term fiscal challenges caused by runaway Washington spending,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nPresident Obama praised the deal for replacing parts of the sequester cuts, which he said \"have harmed students, seniors, and middle-class families and served as a mindless drag on our economy over the last year.\"\\nCalling the deal \"balanced,\" Obama said he also is pleased Congress was able to break the cycle of crisis-driven decision-making to reach a compromise.\\n\"And because it&aposs the first budget that leaders of both parties have agreed to in a few years, the American people should not have to endure the pain of another government shutdown for the next two years,\" he said.\\nThe deal sets discretionary spending levels at just over $1 trillion, which is higher than the hard-fought level of $967 billion set in a 2011 budget pact.\\nOne senior House Republican source predicted to Fox News that the party would have the votes to pass the deal, though they speculated the GOP may lose a \\xe2\\x80\\x9chealthy chunk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on their side.\\nBoth Murray and Ryan expressed confidence the deal would pass as well, and called upon their colleagues to do so.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI&aposm confident we won&apost have 100 percent of the Senate or the House,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Murray said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I want people to know this Congress can work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe hesitation, and opposition, on both sides, though, indicates that congressional leaders still have a lot of convincing to do. Congress has until Jan. 15 to pass a new budget or they will trigger another partial government shutdown.\\nHouse Speaker John Boehner claimed Tuesday he was \"optimistic\" about the chances a deal would materialize, but the speaker may be reluctant to once again try to pass a bill that a majority of Republican members do not support. He resorted to passing a budget bill with a majority of Democrats in October, in order to end the partial shutdown.\\nThe automatic cuts are the consequence of Washington&aposs failure to follow up a 2011 budget pact with further deficit cuts.

      "features:b\"Political panel discusses protests on 'America's News HQ'\\nGod is not a racist. Torch-wielding white nationalists and white supremacists marching through Charlottesville, Virginia, Friday night and rallying again Saturday failed to learn that important lesson. They shouted \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunite the right\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhite lives matter\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and called for the South to split from the United States.\\nThe Friday evening march and the larger \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlt-Right\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rally taking place Saturday came in response to Charlottesville&aposs decision to move a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from Emancipation Park to another park.\\nThe rally is reminiscent of an Alt-Right event in Charlottesville in May, in which white nationalists marched and chanted slogans, including \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRussia is our friend,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhite lives matter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo more brother wars.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe last chant, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo more brother wars,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is a shorthand way of saying that people of European heritage should stop fighting with each other because this only weakens the white brotherhood and strengthens the black, Hispanic, Asian and Native American communities. In other words, it is a call that places racial solidarity ahead of patriotism and loyalty to America.\\nOne of the protest leaders at the May event was Richard Spencer, one of several white nationalists including Jared Taylor and Matthew Heimbach, who have risen to prominence in recent years. They wish to privilege their ethnic group \\xe2\\x80\\x93 white Americans of European descent \\xe2\\x80\\x93 over all others.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur dream is a new society,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Spencer in a 2013 interview, \\xe2\\x80\\x9can ethno-state that would be \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 based on very different ideals than, say, the Declaration of Independence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSimilarly, the white nationalists emphasize what they consider to be the exemplary and unique traits of their race. In a 2005 article in American Renaissance, Taylor wrote: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlacks and whites are different. When blacks are left entirely to their own devices, Western civilization \\xe2\\x80\\x93 any kind of civilization \\xe2\\x80\\x93 disappears.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWhite conservatives \\xe2\\x80\\x93 especially white Christian conservatives \\xe2\\x80\\x93 should speak out openly against white nationalism and white supremacy. This is racism pure and simple, and it represents a frontal assault on the Christian gospel, a denial of human dignity and a subversion of our democracy.\\nThe racist doctrine claiming that whites are superior to all others is diametrically opposed to biblical Christianity. The Bible teaches that God created the world as a dazzlingly beautiful unity-in-diversity (Genesis 1). God values that diversity and makes clear that every human being \\xe2\\x80\\x93 regardless of race \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is created in the image and likeness of God (Genesis 1:27-28).\\nGod sent his son \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a brown Middle Eastern man \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to save the whole world, including sinners of every race and ethnicity (John 3:16). Genuine Christianity overcomes social, ethnic, and gender barriers (Galatians 3:26, 28).\\nThat is why we should fight white nationalism and other forms of racism tooth-and-nail, not only from the voting booth, but in our neighborhoods, at our churches, and on our social media. We should fight it when it takes the form of personal prejudice; when a person of one ethnic heritage intentionally denigrates or harms a person of another ethnic heritage.\\nAnd we should fight racism when it takes the form of corrupted cultural institutions; when our society\\xe2\\x80\\x99s racial sins coalesce to warp certain social and cultural institutions so that they give preference to one race or ethnicity over another.\\nWhite nationalism and supremacy refuse to give equal dignity to all Americans. In response to the Alt-Right\\xe2\\x80\\x99s choice to carry torches, Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis event involving torches at night in Lee Park was either profoundly ignorant or was designed to instill fear in our minority populations in a way that hearkens back to the days of the KKK.\\nSigner is right. When whites bring torches to a nighttime rally, they know that even the most historically unaware American will recognize the event\\xe2\\x80\\x99s similarity to the days of Ku Klux Klan marches, lynchings and fire-bombings.\\nWhite conservatives \\xe2\\x80\\x93 whether they are Christians or not \\xe2\\x80\\x93 should speak out when white nationalists and supremacists degrade the God-given dignity of non-white citizens.\\nWe should draw upon the Bible\\xe2\\x80\\x99s teaching that all humans are created in God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s image. We should point to the Declaration of Independence\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assertion that all human beings are created equal and endowed with unalienable rights. And we should make a conscience-based plea that appeals to our fellow citizens\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ingrained sense of right and wrong.\\nThe doctrines of white nationalism and supremacy subvert the democratic nature of our republic and run afoul of a genuinely Christian theory of politics. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe danger of the ethnic variety of nationalism lies,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d writes political scientist David Koyzis, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin the pursuit of a double standard of justice. When ethnic nationalists come to power in a given state, they privilege the members of their \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 ethnic group over those of other ethnic groups.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAmericans should reject any attempt to value one racial or ethnic group over another. Instead, we should express our conviction that the American government should exercise power with an eye toward justice for all men and women within its borders, no matter what their color, religion or economic status.\\nThroughout American history, there are many ways in which white conservatives have admirably represented Christ and his gospel. I am convinced, however, that overcoming racism is not yet one of the ways that we represent him admirably or consistently.\\nEvents like the one in Charlottesville give good-willed conservatives \\xe2\\x80\\x93 especially Christian conservatives \\xe2\\x80\\x93 an excellent opportunity to begin rectifying the situation by speaking a good word in the midst of a bad moment.\" target:1\n",

      "features:b'The confirmation Tuesday of the first Ebola case on U.S. soil emerges against a backdrop of increasing concern in America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s medical community that preparedness for a pandemic has stagnated or slipped in recent years because of tough economic times and increasing malaise since the 2001 anthrax threat.\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s premier disease fighter, offered an air of confidence Tuesday in declaring that the first Ebola patient in Dallas was carefully contained.\\nBut earlier this year, it sounded less optimistic about the U.S. health care system\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to fight a pandemic should a major disease outbreak occur.\\nPHOTOS: Celebrity deaths in 2014\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCDC continues to work with reduced financial resources, which similarly affects state, local, and insular public health departments. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 These losses make it difficult for state and local health departments to continue to expand their preparedness capabilities, instead forcing them to focus on maintaining their current capabilities,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the CDC warned in a report this year.\\nCDC flagged several key trend lines, including congressional funding for public health emergency preparedness had shrunk by $1 billion from its highs shortly after the 2001 terrorist and anthrax attacks.\\nIt also noted that state and local public health departments on the front lines of any health emergency have shed 45,700 jobs since the 2008 financial crisis.\\nPHOTOS: Child stars: Then and now\\nThe concerns, however, extend far beyond financial resources. The Department of Homeland Security inspector general issued a scathing report in September warning the department was woefully prepared for a pandemic, with expired medicines and inadequate resources to effectively equip its top responders in the field.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDHS may not be able to provide sufficient pandemic preparedness supplies to its employees to continue operations during a pandemic,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s watchdog declared in a report made public Sept. 1.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWithout sufficiently determining its needs, the department has no assurance it will have an adequate amount of antiviral [drugs] to maintain critical operations during a pandemic,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the report said, warning of the effects for offices such as the Secret Service, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Transportation Security Administration.\\nDespite having the task of protecting the U.S. from dangerous threats, the Homeland Security Department \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdid not keep accurate records of what it purchased and it received,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inspector general found.\\nHomeland Security officials disagreed with much of the report, saying it was a misrepresentation of the agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s preparedness for an outbreak.\\nOther preparedness concerns flagged in recent months include the ability of overburdened Border Patrol agents to screen immigrants for disease and inadequate tools to detect or combat a bioterrorist attack.\\nFor instance, numerous government investigations have questioned the adequacy of the federal government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s premier biosurveillance system, code named BioWatch. The respected National Academies of Science questioned whether the current-generation system can detect hazards, and the next generation of the project is in danger of being canceled after the Government Accountability Office questioned its dealing with contractors.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOver the past several years, our work has identified significant shortcomings in the department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to manage an expanding portfolio of major acquisitions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the GAO report, dated June 10. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe recommended that before continuing the Gen-3 acquisition, DHS should carry out key acquisition steps, including reevaluating the mission need and systematically analyzing alternatives based on cost-benefit and risk information.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe message from the panoply of reports is clear: Although the U.S. clearly made strides after 2001 on pandemic preparation, those gains have stagnated and in some cases begun to reverse even as the risks for an outbreak grow with global travel and determined terrorists.\\nPeople say that Ebola looks \\xe2\\x80\\x9cso far away, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so remote,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Dr. J. Scott Ries, vice president of Christian Medical & Dental Associations, who worked with Ebola survivor Dr. Kent Brantly, who contracted the disease while treating Ebola patients in Liberia. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell now, anyone who has thought that will change their opinion. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s here, like we predicted, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time to massively ramp up our efforts to address this.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nTo be sure, the CDC says it will contain the incident in Texas, and the Ebola virus will not spread in the U.S. like it has in West African countries because of U.S. isolation methods, first-world medical care, and the fact that friends and relatives don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t intimately prepare bodies for burial as is customary in West Africa.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is no doubt in my mind, we will stop it here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said in a press conference Tuesday. Although Ebola is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cscary disease,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe are stopping it in its tracks in this country.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWorrisome, however, is that the infected patient in Texas waited four days after he began experiencing symptoms to seek admission to the Dallas hospital. During that time, he was symptomatic and contagious. Ebola doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t spread via airborne methods like the flu does, but only through contact with bodily fluids such as blood, feces, urine and vomit.\\nThe CDC said it was monitoring the people with whom the infected patient came into contact. Ebola starts with a high fever and leads to internal bleeding. In Africa, it has a mortality rate as high as 90 percent.\\nThe West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have experienced the worst outbreak of the disease in history, killing more than 3,000 people there and infecting others. A total of 6,574 cases have been reported, according to the World Health Organization. There is a separate outbreak in Congo.\\nDr. Ries said news of a U.S. Ebola case is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno surprise,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but there is also \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno need to panic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe know how to deal with Ebola. While Ebola is highly infectious, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not highly contagious,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, adding that the Dallas patient has been isolated and is being treated aggressively.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the advantage we have here with our health system versus what they have in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nNevertheless, U.S. policymakers renewed alarm that the African outbreak had reached American shores.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCommunicable diseases do not stop at borders,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Rep. Edward R. Royce, California Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhile the likelihood of a major outbreak in the United States is still very unlikely, with this case, it is more clear than ever that the rapid spread of Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone presents a clear and present danger not only to West Africa, but the broader international community.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSen. Rob Portman, Ohio Republican, renewed his call for the CDC to direct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to enact active screening of travelers demonstrating Ebola symptoms at U.S. ports of entry.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhile I hope that this is an isolated case, today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s announcement serves as a reminder of the need for increased U.S. prevention efforts,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Portman said in a statement. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAccording to reports, the patient had recently travelled to West Africa and would have been a clear candidate for active screening. With this announcement, I hope the CDC will consider enacting elevated screening levels.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThree American medical missionaries other than Dr. Brantly became infected and fell ill in Africa while treating Ebola patients. All were flown back to the U.S. in isolation and have recovered.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe lessons learned\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from treating those workers at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta and elsewhere showed that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis is a disease that we can manage with tech,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Michael G. Schmidt, vice chairman of the microbiology and immunology department at the Medical University of South Carolina.\\nCredit also goes, he said, to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe convalescent serum and ZMAPP\\xe2\\x80\\x9d administered to Ebola patients, and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunsung heroes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d within local health departments, public health agencies and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwho have been planning for this event since\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Ebola outbreak flared up in March.\\nA White House statement said President Obama had spoken via phone Tuesday with Dr. Frieden and discussed Ebola isolation protocols and efforts to figure out where the patient may have contracted the virus.\\nThe CDC said the Dallas patient was asymptomatic during his flight from Liberia to Dallas. Although he likely contracted the disease abroad, he was not contagious during air travel or noticeably sick on arrival.\\nCBP works in conjunction with the CDC to monitor travelers and attempt to contain any diseases that may be spread by travelers from abroad.\\nHowever, given CBP\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current resources and other strains at the border given the recent influx of unaccompanied minors, it may not be well-equipped to handle another crisis, the Congressional Research Service warned in a report.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the current context of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, CDC has emphasized exit-based airport screening from areas with Ebola, and not screening at [point of entry] in the United States,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d wrote Ruth Ellen Wasem, an immigration specialist in a Congressional Research Service report dated Aug. 13.\\nMs. Wasem warned that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfrom an immigration standpoint, an outbreak of an infectious disease places substantial procedural and resource pressures on CBP.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Philip Swarts and Cheryl Wetzstein contributed to this report.\\nCopyright \\xc2\\xa9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

      "features:b'National security panel reacts to latest reports on &aposThe Kelly File&apos\\nAn intense search continued Thursday in the Mediterranean Sea off Greece for wreckage of an EgyptAir flight that went down earlier in the day with 66 people on board, as multiple U.S. officials told Fox News that no explosion was detected by infrared satellites in the vicinity of the crash area.\\nThere were conflicting reports throughout the day as to if any debris from the plane was spotted by search crews.\\nOfficials from EgyptAir initially said debris from the plane was found off the Greek island of Karpathos. Athanassios Binis, head of Greece&aposs Air Accident Investigation and Aviation Safety Board, later told state ERT TV that \"an assessment of the finds showed that they do not belong to an aircraft,\" The Associated Press reported. Binis added that this has been confirmed by Egyptian authorities.\\nLater in the day, Ahmed Adel, Vice President of EgyptAir, told CNN the debris found Thursday was not from Flight 804.\\n\"We stand corrected on finding the wreckage because what we found was not parts of our plane,\" he said. Adel added the search for wreckage will continue on Friday.\\nSeveral U.S. officials told Fox News that spy satellites used to detect missile launches and explosions around the world did not detect an explosion in the area where the EgyptAir flight crashed.\\nCairo-bound EgyptAir Flight 804 dropped from the sky hours after departing from Paris. The plane banked and spun sharply before plunging less than an hour before it was due to land in Cairo at 3:15 a.m. local time, according to aviation officials. Authorities have said terrorism was a more likely cause of the crash than technical failure.\\nGreek military officials said a Greek C-130 military transport plane is still participating in the search for debris from the EgyptAir jet, but a frigate initially sent to the area has been recalled.\\nA Greek military official told The Associated Press planes had earlier spotted debris 230 miles south-southeast of the island of Crete but still within the Egyptian air traffic control area. Two other floating objects, colored white and red, were spotted in the same area, Greek defense sources told Reuters.\\nSpeaking from Cairo, Egyptian Minister of Aviation Sherif Fathy said the AirBus 320, which left Charles de Gaulle Airport at 11:09 p.m. local time Wednesday and was due in Cairo at 3:15 a.m., \"vanished.\"\\n\"I&aposm not excluding any theory,\" said Fathy, who responded to a reporter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s question by saying that the possibility of a terror attack as the cause of the crash is \"stronger\" than technical failure.\\nGreek officials say the plane banked and spun sharply just before dropping.\\n\"The plane carried out a 90-degree turn to the left and a 360-degree turn to the right, falling from 37,000 to 15,000 feet and the signal was lost at around 10,000 feet,\" Greece\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Defense Minister Panos Kammenos told a news conference Thursday.\\nGreek air traffic controllers tried to make contact as the plane left Greek airspace, but the pilot did not respond, he said. They continued to try to reach the pilot until 2:29 a.m. Cairo time, when the plane disappeared from the radar 7 miles southeast of the island of Crete.\\nWhat is unknown about the plane&aposs final moments in the air could be consistent with terrorism, David Learmount, a leading British air analyst, told Fox News.\\n\"All this says is that the plane was destabilized . . . it doesn&apost say why,\" Learmount said.\\nLearmount said it is possible that a bomb or someone with a gun or knife entering the cockpit could de-stabilize a plane, but also pointed out that a mechanical or technical defect, as well as human error, could also de-stabilize the aircraft.\\nCongressman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told reporters Thursday he spoke with the head of the Transportation Security Administration.\\nMcCaul added that there are indicators of an event similar to that in October when a Russian passenger plane was blown out of the sky over the Sinai Peninsula using a timed bomb.\\nSen. Diane Feinstein, top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters Thursday she hasn&apost been briefed on the EgyptAir crash but that there was \"strong probability that the plane went down with an act of terror.\"\\nFlight 804 was carrying 56 passengers, including one child and two babies, three security staff and seven crew members, officials said. Fathy said identities would not be released until relatives could be contacted, but described those on board as including 15 French passengers, 30 Egyptians, one Briton, two Iraqis, one Kuwaiti, one Saudi, one Sudanese, one Chadian, one Portuguese, one Algerian and one Canadian.\\nAmong passengers on missing EgyptAir Flight 804 was a student training at a French military school who was heading to his family home in Chad to mourn his mother.\\nThe protocol officer for Chad&aposs embassy in Paris, Muhammed Allamine, said the man \"was going to give condolences to his family.\" Allamine said the man, who wasn&apost identified, was a student at France&aposs prestigious Saint-Cyr army academy.\\nAnother passenger on the flight was an Egyptian man returning home after medical treatment in France, according to two shocked friends who turned up at Paris&apos Charles de Gaulle airport.\\n\"It breaks my heart,\" said one friend, Madji Samaan.\\nKuwait&aposs Foreign Ministry identified a Kuwaiti feared dead in the crash as Abdulmohsen al-Muteiri, but offered no other details.\\nIn Paris, relatives started arriving at De Gaulle Airport outside the French capital.A man and a woman, identified by airport staff as relatives of passengers, sat at an information desk near the EgyptAir counter.\\nThe woman sobbed, holding her face in a handkerchief. The pair were led away by police.\\nOfficials offered conflicting reports of an emergency beacon being picked up two hours after the plane had dropped off from radar. The Egyptian military said that no such distress call was received, but didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t specify whether they were confirming an initial report or dismissing an EgyptAir statement.\\nDefense officials told Fox News Thursday that the U.S. Navy is flying P-3 reconnaissance aircraft to assist in the search effort.\\nAnother U.S. government official said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has been briefed at least twice on the missing plane, and that at this early stage, everything is on the table as the government is \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctied in tight\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with French and Egyptian investigators.\\nThe White House also said in a statement that President Obama has been briefed on the crash.\\nGreece&aposs defense minister, Panos Kammenos, said Greece has a submarine on standby which is participating in a NATO exercise about 100 miles away from the presumed crash area, while F-16 fighter jets stationed on Crete could also be used if necessary. The country already has a navy frigate, two military transport planes and a radar plane participating in the search operation, while he said Egypt had sent a C-130 military transport plane and two F-16s.\\nHollande and French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault offered to send military planes and boats to join the search for wreckage.\\n\"We are at the disposition of the Egyptian authorities with our military capacities, with our planes, our boats to help in the search for this plane,\" Ayrault said. He spoke as Hollande held an emergency meeting at the Elysee Palace.\\nLater, the French military said a Falcon surveillance jet monitoring the Mediterranean for migrants had been diverted to help search for the EgyptAir plane. Military spokesman Col. Gilles Jaron told The Associated Press that the jet is joining the Egypt-led search effort, and the French Navy may send another plane and a ship to the zone.\\nHours after the plane disappeared on Thursday, Fathy told reporters in Cairo that the diameter of the search area will widen, moving further south of the island of Karpathos.\\nHollande spoke with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi on the phone earlier Thursday and agreed to \"closely cooperate to establish as soon as possible the circumstances\" in which the EgyptAir flight disappeared, according to a statement issued in Paris.\\nIn Cairo, el-Sissi convened an emergency meeting of the National Security Council, the country&aposs highest security body. The council includes the prime minister and the defense, foreign and interior ministers, in addition to the chiefs of the intelligence agencies.\\nThe Airbus A320 is a widely used twin-engine, single-aisle plane that operates on short and medium-haul routes. Nearly 4,000 A320s are currently in use around the world. The versions EgyptAir operates are equipped to carry 145 passengers.\\nThe French Prosecutor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office said they will launch an investigation into the EgyptAir crash. The country remains under a state of emergency after terror attacks by the Islamic State killed 130 people in November.\\nThe Associated Press reported that around 15 family members of passengers on board the missing flight had arrived at Cairo airport Thursday morning. Airport authorities brought doctors to the scene after several distressed family members collapsed.\\nThe incident renewed security concerns months after a Russian passenger plane was blown out of the sky over the Sinai Peninsula. The Russian plane crashed in Sinai on Oct. 31, killing all 224 people on board. Moscow said it was brought down by an explosive device, and a local branch of ISIS has claimed responsibility for planting it.\\nIn 1999, EgyptAir Flight 1990 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near the Massachusetts island of Nantucket, killing all 217 people aboard. U.S. investigators filed a final report that concluded its co-pilot switched off the autopilot and pointed the Boeing 767 downward. But Egyptian officials rejected the notion of suicide altogether, insisting some mechanical reason caused the crash.\\nIn March, an EgyptAir plane was hijacked and diverted to Cyprus. A man who admitted to the hijacking and was described by Cypriot authorities as \"psychologically unstable\" is in custody.\\nFox News&apos Greg Palkot, Lucas Tomlinson, Catherine Herridge and The Associated Press contributed to this report' target:1\n",

      "features:b'The Justice Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to appoint former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special counsel charged with investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia is a win for Democrats, a new blow to a reeling White House, and a clear sign that the scandal that has engulfed the administration will only accelerate in the weeks and months ahead.\\nIt wasn\\'t just the decision to appoint a special counsel that raised eyebrows. It was also the person put into the job: Mueller, who spent his career in the FBI and who takes the post just weeks after Trump startled lawmakers and officials from both parties by abruptly firing FBI Director James Comey (who is also, incidentally, Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s close friend).\\nIn the aftermath of the firing, congressional Democrats began calling for a special counsel or special prosecutor to take over the investigation because of fears that the Justice Department wouldn\\'t be able or willing to properly investigate Trump and his current and former aides. But few seemed to think that would actually happen.\\nThat\\'s why the announcement by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein came as a surprise to so many people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including the White House, which was reportedly given just 30 minutes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 warning before the announcement went public.\\nIf Rosenstein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name sounds familiar, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because the administration initially claimed that Trump only decided to fire Comey after Rosenstein sent a letter to the White House recommending that he do so. This turned out to have been a lie \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Trump later admitted that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d already decided to fire Comey long before Rosenstein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter.\\nSo when Rosenstein announced that he had appointed a special counsel, it had the feel of a career lawyer with a reputation for probity and nonpartisanship striking a blow at a White House that had thrown him under the bus by trying to make him the scapegoat for the Comey firing.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy decision is not a finding that crimes have been committed or that any prosecution is warranted,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rosenstein said in a DOJ press release. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have made no such determination. What I have determined is that based upon the unique circumstances, the public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThere\\'s a lot to unpack there, including the fact that Mueller won\\'t have the powers many people assume. He also won\\'t be entirely independent. But he\\'ll have a lot of power all the same \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and is probably almost literally the last person Trump would want in the job.\\nA special counsel is weaker than an independent special prosecutor\\nSpecial prosecutors and special counsels are both appointed to remove conflicts of interest in federal criminal investigations, if the situation would otherwise lead to officials investigating their own superiors. They are supposed to be independent, usually either judges or highly respected attorneys.\\nBut while the two terms are often used interchangeably in the media \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and, more confusingly, by members of Congress who should know better \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not quite the same thing.\\nIn 1978, in the wake of the Watergate scandal, Congress passed the Ethics in Government Act, creating something called a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspecial prosecutor\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (also called an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindependent counsel\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) who would be independent from the supervision and control of the president. The role was to investigate and prosecute \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in a court of law \\xe2\\x80\\x94 possible violations of federal law by high-level officials.\\nThe 1978 law also created a special three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, appointed by the chief justice of the Supreme Court, that would be responsible for appointing and overseeing a special prosecutor when formally asked to do so by the attorney general.\\nUnder that law, only the attorney general had the authority to request that the panel appoint a special prosecutor. Majorities on either the House or Senate Judiciary Committee could formally ask the attorney general to file a request, but \\xe2\\x80\\x94 because of the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the attorney general could still technically say no. They would merely have to tell Congress why they were refusing to do it.\\nThe law creating special prosecutors expired in 1999, when Congress chose not to renew it. That meant that the whole mechanism for establishing an independent special prosecutor went away.\\nSo the Justice Department decided instead to use its own powers to create something similar within the department itself: a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspecial counsel.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThis person is appointed directly by the attorney general (not an independent three-judge panel, like before) and \\xe2\\x80\\x94 this is the important part \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is thus directly answerable to the attorney general. This person can pursue criminal indictments in grand jury investigations, but the attorney general can fire them at any time and overrule any decisions they make when it comes to investigating or prosecuting the case.\\nIn other words, the special counsel is far, far less independent than the earlier version was.\\nStill, it\\'s a powerful post. Mueller will be able to issue subpoenas, forcing people to testify and turn over documents. Whether he chooses to do so, of course, remains to be seen.\\nSo that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we have today. In this case, Attorney General Jeff Sessions had already formally recused himself from participating in any Trump-Russia investigations, so the next person in line, Rosenstein, was the person with the authority to appoint a special counsel.\\nWhat does this mean for the investigation going forward?\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSpecial Counsel Mueller will have all appropriate resources to conduct a thorough and complete investigation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rosenstein said in the DOJ announcement.\\nSo what, exactly, is the FBI chief investigating?\\nThe order specifically gives Muller the legal authority to investigate \\xe2\\x80\\x9cany links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as well as any crimes that may take place during the investigation, including things like perjury, obstruction of justice, and witness intimidation.\\nAnd if Mueller finds enough evidence, he can seek an indictment against the suspect or suspects from a federal grand jury. If the grand jury chooses to indict, the case would then potentially go to a federal criminal trial.\\nHowever, there are some caveats.\\nPeter Zeidenberg, who served as the assistant special counsel in the investigation of former White House aide Scooter Libby in 2005, noted in a recent Washington Post op-ed that special counsels \\xe2\\x80\\x9care not journalists, and their job is not to inform the public of the results of their investigations.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRather, their mission is to gather all of the relevant facts and determine whether a crime was committed and, if so, whether it can be proved in court beyond a reasonable doubt,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Zeidenberg wrote. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTheir work, when done properly, is done in secret.\"\\nWhich means that Mueller could very well find a bunch of fishy or wildly inappropriate stuff that Trump or his campaign team did, but if none of those things were actually illegal \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or if Mueller doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think he has enough evidence to bring the case to federal court \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the public might never hear about any of the stuff he found.\\n(There are still the separate and ongoing House and Senate probes into Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Russia ties, though, and the members of Congress involved in those probes could presumably subpoena any documents the special counsel investigation collected and choose to reveal those to the public if they wanted to.)\\nAnd, of course, Mueller can still be dismissed at any time by Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein, who can in turn be dismissed by Trump.' target:-1\n",

      "features:b'7:30 a.m.: Because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m old I fell asleep before they finalized the DC convention returns, but it was nearly a split decision. The most inside the beltway vote went to the two candidates most perceived as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cestablishment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d this cycle. Marco Rubio took it with 37.3% of the vote and Ohio Governor John Kasich was right behind him at 35.5. Rubio gets 10 of the delegates and Kasich takes 9. Trump came in third with 13.8% and Cruz brought up the rear at 12.4. Neither will receive delegates from this race.\\n=======\\n3:37am: Washington Post reports Rubio wins the DC primary:\\nAnnounced results gave Rubio 37.3 percent of the 2,839 votes cast. Kasich was close behind with 35.5 percent, a difference of less than two percentage points. That suggested that each might get nearly the same number of delegates.\\nDonald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) trailed by substantial margins. Trump got 13.8 percent of the votes and Cruz 12.4 percent.\\n7:45: With most of the county conventions reporting, the party leaders and committee members have voted and Ted Cruz took the lion\\xe2\\x80\\x99s share of support. Current estimate is that Ted Cruz will get 9 delegates today while Marco Rubio and Donald Trump get one each. The state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s other 29 delegates will be awarded at the state convention next month.\\n=======\\nIf you happen to be watching cable news today as your primary source of keeping up to date on the election you might not have any idea that there are three primary elections going on. (Sort of.) The first primary is in the District of Columbia, but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bit of a misnomer because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not really a primary, nor is it a caucus. DC doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t impact the GOP in the general election because the Republicans know they won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even get 10% of the vote, but they do get to participate in the primary. They have a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconvention\\xe2\\x80\\x9d today where anyone who is registered as a member of the Republican Party can visit a single convention roughly two blocks from the White House and hopefully all eleven of the Republicans in the district will show up to vote. Who will they support? As Politico puts it\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 that might be a bit awkward.\\nAfter spending a year turning \\xe2\\x80\\x9cD.C. Republicans\\xe2\\x80\\x9d into a campaign epithet, GOP primary candidates Saturday will find themselves looking to actual D.C. Republicans for some much-needed support\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\nMarco Rubio has made no secret of his disdain for the workings of the Senate, and John Kasich\\xe2\\x80\\x94whose campaign frequently touts his Congressional experience\\xe2\\x80\\x94has taken to describing himself as an outsider who can get things done in the way Washington Republicans can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\nThose are warm and fuzzy relationships compared with what Trump and Cruz have to say about D.C. Republicans on a regular basis. Trump summed up his views like this in August: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur leaders are stupid. Our politicians are stupid\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94a line he repeats regularly. And every election night, Cruz tells his supporters some version of the sentiments expressed in this tweet: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe screaming you hear now from across the Potomac is the Washington Cartel in full terror that the conservative grassroots are rising up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThere are 19 delegates up for grabs today, and given how everyone expects the race to 1,237 to come down to the wire (if anyone reaches it) nobody can take even one for granted. The rules for the DC convention are yet another hybrid. They are assigned proportionally to any candidate meeting a 15% threshold, but they have a trigger which will allow the winner to sweep all 19 if they make it to 50% plus one. Voting took place from 10 this morning until 4 this afternoon, but as with most things in DC it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s never that simple. Any voters with religious restrictions on voting during the day can come and vote after dark. We should have results after 9 pm and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll update this post at that time.\\nThere are two other races going on today that you probably won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any interest in keeping an eye on. This first one is the GOP primary in Guam. It won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be done until long after I go to bed and it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really matter to the candidates anyway. The residents of the island will be voting to pick one dozen delegates to the convention, but they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bound to any candidate so they can vote for whoever they want when they get to Cleveland. So why bother having a primary, you ask? Hey.. if you lived on Guam wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you want an all expense paid trip to Ohio this summer?\\nThe last race is in Wyoming, but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a full primary either. Today they will hold \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconventions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in each county to select a total of 12 delegates. But they still have to have another primary next month to pick their remaining 17 delegates. Why do they do it that way? Go find somebody from Wyoming, ask them, then come back and explain it to me. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just Wyoming.\\nSo there you have it. Until DC finishes up their business tonight we now return you to your regularly scheduled Saturday business.' target:1\n",
      "features:b'Secretary of Education DeVos to chair a commission on school safety.\\nAfter Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appearance on CBS\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9c60 Minutes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on Sunday night, progressive media outlets and personalities mocked her performance as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctrainwreck\\xe2\\x80\\x9d saying that she \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstumbled,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstruggled,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstunk up\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the interview.\\nAlthough Secretary DeVos did struggle to answer some questions on the spot, the substance and tone of the criticisms are inaccurate and unfair.\\nNone of this should be surprising. Secretary DeVos, a Christian grandmother and philanthropist who has spent her career trying to improve the quality of education for poor children, has been criticized and mocked relentlessly. And she is the only Cabinet secretary who travels with a cadre of U. S. Marshals because of death threats she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s received.\\nSo why, as \\xe2\\x80\\x9c60 Minutes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Lesley Stahl put it, has Secretary DeVos become the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmost hated Cabinet secretary?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nOne reason\\xe2\\x80\\x94as opinion pieces in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal have argued\\xe2\\x80\\x94is that some of the Democratic party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most deep-pocketed and powerful interest groups are teachers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 unions who realize that they will no longer have a near-monopoly on education.\\nAnother reason, as the New York Times\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Ross Douthat argued, is that the Democratic party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s upper-middle-class suburbanite constituency \\\\- who are big supporters, in theory, of public education \\xe2\\x80\\x93 bristle at the idea of DeVos\\xe2\\x80\\x99 charters and vouchers being attractive to poor and minority families (who in their view belong in public schools) or families with ideological or religious convictions that differ from their own.\\nOn second thought, I guess it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not so hard to understand why the left\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard-core education bureaucracy is so opposed to her. She is a serious threat to the status quo that has served them \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if not students \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so well.\\nPerhaps the most significant reason, however, is the one Secretary DeVos gave in response to Stahl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s question: more than anything else, she is misunderstood.\\nTo clear up any misunderstanding caused by the left\\xe2\\x80\\x99s holy war against her, here are four things Americans should understand about Secretary DeVos\\xe2\\x80\\x99 educational vision:\\nFirst, as she noted in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9c60 Minutes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d interview, Secretary DeVos wants to liberate American education from encroachment by federal bureaucracy. Under the Obama administration, the federal government functioned as a giant octopus, bypassing families, communities, and states in order to reach its tentacles into school curriculum, teacher evaluation, values conformity, and even restroom policies. Betsy DeVos signals a departure from that era. Her stated educational philosophy suggests that she will not turn Democratic encroachment into Republican encroachment; instead, she will reduce federal encroachment in order to empower families, local communities, and states.\\nSecond, Secretary DeVos emphasizes freedom of thought. During her confirmation hearings, the media made much ado about her \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDutch Calvinist\\xe2\\x80\\x9d religious views. But Dutch Calvinism is a rich religious tradition that emphasizes the rights and freedoms of families, communities, and religions. For that reason, it finds adherents on the right and on the left. Additionally, it places an especially high value on education, but emphasizes that a plural society should be tolerant enough to allow diverse families and communities to build their own educational institutions and choose which institution(s) their children can attend. Unfortunately, many liberal educators are quite illiberal, unwilling to tolerate any type of educational diversity that undermines the federal government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impulse toward command-and-control.\\nThird, she wants to empower financially-disadvantaged families to send their children to whichever school they deem best. Under the current system, the government taxes citizens in order to provide education, but then dictates and determines how the tax money can be used. The message is clear: the federal government\\xe2\\x80\\x94rather than the family or local community\\xe2\\x80\\x94is responsible for shaping the way a child understands and interprets the world.\\nUnder Secretary DeVos\\xe2\\x80\\x99 system of vouchers and charters, however, citizens will be able to exercise more influence over their own child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s education. They will also be able to send their children to a wider variety of schools, including those that would have been financially prohibitive without the vouchers. This sort of system is supported by prominent intellectuals and educators such as Anthony Bradley and has been supported in the past by Democratic politicians such as Cory Booker.\\nFourth, Secretary Devos does not come to her job as a career politician or an educational ideologue. She comes as a lifelong education advocate and philanthropist who has given tens of millions of dollars to public and private educational institutions.\\nAs her \\xe2\\x80\\x9c60 Minutes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d interview made clear, Secretary DeVos is an imperfect Secretary of Education, as all secretaries of education have been. She is neither a career politician nor a pundit.\\nWhat she is is a skilled educational advocate and a lifelong educational philanthropist whose vision for education could reduce bureaucracy, increase free thinking, and empower the financially disadvantaged, thus helping children to get the education they deserve.\\nOn second thought, I guess it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not so hard to understand why the left\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard-core education bureaucracy is so opposed to her. She is a serious threat to the status quo that has served them \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if not students \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so well.\\nGood-thinking Americans on the left and right should reject the mainstream media narrative and pull for Secretary DeVos as she tries to reform and shake up these aspects of our nations\\xe2\\x80\\x99 educational system.' target:1\n",

      "features:b'WASHINGTON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, said on Sunday he would support the nuclear deal with Iran, moving President Barack Obama a step closer to having sufficient backing to ensure the deal stands.\\n\"I believe the agreement, titled the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), is the best available strategy to block Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon,\" Merkley wrote in a statement published on Medium.com.\\nObama is trying to muster 34 votes in the Senate to ensure lawmakers cannot kill the deal. Thirty-one senators, all Democrats and independents who vote with Democrats, have now said they will support it.\\nCongress must vote on the deal by Sept. 17. The following describes how votes are likely to play out: \\x7f\\nWhen Congress returns on Sept. 8 from its August recess, debate will begin on a Republican-sponsored \"resolution of disapproval\" against the deal. \\x7f\\nIn the Senate, Republicans must gather 60 votes to move the resolution forward under Senate procedural rules. If they can, they will then need a simple majority of 51 votes in the chamber to approve the resolution. It would pass, because Republicans control a majority of Senate seats and most have already come out against the agreement.\\n\\x7fThere is no similar procedural barrier in the House. The resolution is expected to easily win approval there. Republicans hold 246 seats in the 435-seat House. \\x7f\\nIf both chambers approve the resolution, it would go to Obama\\'s desk for review. He has vowed to veto it. \\x7f\\nIf he does so, opponents would then try to override the veto. This would take a two-thirds majority vote in each chamber. The Senate has 100 members; the House, 434, plus one vacant seat. \\x7f\\nDemocrats could block an override in the Senate with 34 votes. So far, 31 senators have committed to voting in favor of the deal; 31 have said they will oppose it. \\x7f\\nIn the House, if Republicans voted unanimously against the deal, they would need to get at least 44 Democrats to vote with them to override a veto. \\x7f\\nThe Iran deal is not a treaty, so it does not need the two-thirds vote in the Senate to be ratified. The \"resolution of disapproval\" mechanism was included in a law Obama signed in May giving Congress the right to weigh in on the nuclear deal with Iran. \\x7f\\nIf Congress were to pass a resolution of disapproval and override a veto, Obama would be barred from waiving most of the U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran over its nuclear program. Proponents of the agreement say this would kill the deal.\\n(Reporting by Alina Selyukh and Eric Walsh; Additional reporting by Alex Wilts, Susan Cornwell and Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Alison Williams)' target:-1\n",

John McCain (R-Ariz.) said in a statement on Sunday. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEmboldened by American inaction, Assad has reportedly launched another chemical attack against innocent men, women and children.\"\\n\"It\\'s not too late to stop Assad\\'s impunity and begin to rewrite this terrible chapter in our history,\" he said.\\nRegardless of how Trump decides to respond, his criticism of Putin was unusual.\\nTrump has raised questions in the past among allies and critics alike for his reluctance to criticize Putin, especially given his willingness to verbally accost everyone from Republican senators to the mayor of a hurricane-ravaged city. Trump has been especially reluctant to blame Russia for its interference in the 2016 election, which the intelligence community concluded was aimed at helping Trump. Special counsel Robert Mueller is currently leading an investigation into the election meddling and whether the Trump campaign colluded in the effort.\\nBut chemical weapons attacks, particularly those that result in the deaths of children, have proved galvanizing for Trump. After an April 2017 attack, he launched missile strikes in Syria. Trump spoke repeatedly about the deaths of \\xe2\\x80\\x9csmall children\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbeautiful little babies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and seemed to be deeply affected by media images of the dead.\\nHe has criticized former President Barack Obama, who said the use of chemical weapons would be a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cred line\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in Syria but later declined to use military force in response to such an attack. Trump tweeted Sunday: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf President Obama had crossed his stated Red Line In The Sand, the Syrian disaster would have ended long ago! Animal Assad would have been history!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe recent attack seems to have again shaken the White House, with homeland security adviser Tom Bossert saying on Sunday that all options are on the table.\\nTrump could consider an array of responses, including another round of strikes or a U.N. Security Council resolution. However, because of Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position in the council, it could veto any such resolution.\\nAmerican allies also condemned the attack, with British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson releasing a statement calling it \\xe2\\x80\\x9chorrific\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and demanding that Russia not impede any investigation into the attack.\\nBut the latest escalation in rhetoric comes at an awkward time for the White House, as Trump has said he wants to end American military involvement in Syria. The White House said recently that the military mission there \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis coming to a rapid end.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe United States says that both Russia and Iran are responsible for aiding the Syrian regime in its attacks on civilians.\\nNahal Toosi contributed to this report.' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'May 2, 2013: President Obama speaks in the Rose Garden of the White House, where he announced his pick for Commerce secretary, Penny Pritzker, right. (AP)\\nPresident Obama&aposs nominee for Commerce secretary was embroiled in a massive bank failure more than a decade ago, in a collapse that cost depositors and federal insurers millions of dollars.\\nThe 2001 collapse of Superior Bank FSB now appears likely to re-emerge, more than a decade later, as Commerce nominee Penny Pritzker prepares for a confirmation hearing and Republicans already draw attention to the bank implosion.\\nPritzker&aposs family, which founded Hyatt and is one of the wealthiest in the country, co-owned Superior Bank at the time of its collapse. The lawyer who represented depositors in the case told FoxNews.com on Thursday that the Pritzker family enjoyed a \"special deal\" while the \"little guys\" ended up \"footing the bill.\"\\n\"The message of our Cabinet members should be people who do the right thing,\" attorney Clint Krislov said Thursday. \"And it should not be a message of, if you&aposre very wealthy you get a special deal and you get to sit on the Cabinet, too.\"\\nUninsured depositors at the Illinois bank are still owed roughly $10 million, according to federal records -- after a court challenge was rejected in 2007, those savings may never be recovered. The collapse also cost the FDIC, which insures banks, nearly $300 million.\\nThe failure, according to federal regulators, was triggered by a pattern of risky lending.\\nThe Office of Thrift Supervision took the rare step of shuttering the Hinsdale, Ill., bank on July 27, 2001. The office said at the time the bank \"suffered as a result of its former high-risk business strategy,\" including \"significant volumes of subprime\" mortgage and auto loans.\\nWhat happened after the collapse, though, is what triggered the lawsuit involving Krislov.\\nThe Pritzker family, as part of a settlement to shield itself from liability, agreed to pay $460 million to the federal government. But the family was subsequently able to claim part of a separate $125 million settlement from the bank&aposs accounting firm.\\nKrislov said the family was first in line for the money, followed by the depositors.\\n\"That is what is fundamentally troubling,\" he said. \"They got a priority ahead of depositors while depositors were still short.\"\\nAn FDIC representative, though, suggested to the Chicago Tribune in 2004 that the sheer size of the $460 million settlement justified the trade-off.\\n\"If it means $30 million is turned over to the Pritzkers, I think it&aposs hard to dispute that it&aposs not advantageous for creditors of that failed institution,\" the spokesman said.\\nPritzker&aposs involvement with the bank&aposs questionable lending practices is unclear. She served as chairwoman of the bank from 1991 to 1994, after her uncle Jay went in with another wealthy family to buy Superior in the late &apos80s.\\nPritzker spokeswoman Susan Anderson stressed that Pritzker was not an officer or director at the time the bank failed.\\n\"She left its board in 1994, seven years before the bank failed. During her tenure, the bank received clean audits and regulators gave it high marks,\" she said in an email to FoxNews.com, calling her record as a manager \"extraordinary.\"\\nShe also noted that despite the losses sustained by depositors, they did get 81 percent of their savings back, in addition to the $100,000 insured amount. \"This is ... typical when a bank fails,\" she said.\\nThe FDIC insures depositors for up to $100,000. In the case of Superior, those with accounts above that amount were still repaid part -- but not all -- of their uninsured savings.\\nKrislov said he wrote to Penny Pritzker after his clients lost their suit asking her to pay the remaining $10 million to the uninsured depositors.\\n\"I just figured it was the right thing to do,\" he said, adding that he never heard back.\\nThe Pritzker family also reportedly struck a deal in 2011 that allowed them to enjoy a discount off the $460 million settlement.\\nThe history of the bank was glossed over in Thursday&aposs announcement at the White House, though the Republican National Committee blasted out old news clippings from the saga.\\nObama, during the nomination ceremony, cited Pritzker&aposs \"extraordinary experience.\"\\n\"Penny is one of our countries&apos most distinguished business leaders. She&aposs got more than 25 years of management experience in industries, including real estate, finance, and hospitality. She&aposs built companies from the ground up,\" Obama said.\\nPritzker is on the board with Hyatt Hotels Corp., which was co-founded by her dad. She&aposs also chairwoman of Pritzker Realty Group. She previously served on Obama&aposs jobs council, and helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for the president&aposs 2008 and 2012 campaigns -- she held positions with both campaigns.\\nPritzker is also one of the wealthiest people in the country. Forbes pegs her net worth at $1.85 billion, and lists her as the 277th wealthiest person in the U.S.\\nKrislov acknowledged the family has done some \"very terrific things\" in philanthropy, but said: \"She would not be my first pick\" for Commerce.\\nThe White House did not return a request for comment.' target:1\n",
      "features:b'Maqndel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\\nBy MICHAEL FALCONE ( @michaelpfalcone )\\nNOTABLES\\nTHE ROUNDTABLE\\nABC\\'s RICK KLEIN: Harry Reid\\'s mouth may be all the legislative reality-checking we need on guns. The Senate majority leader\\'s take on gun control, as outlined on ABC\\'s \"This Week,\" stands as a decent handicapping of the battle ahead. Specifically, the realistic realm of possibility - the easy stuff, though it won\\'t be all that easy - involves expanded background checks and limits on high-capacity clips. It\\'s the assault-weapons ban - the one Reid, son of Nevada and holder of a B rating from the NRA - that may be a bridge too far. For President Obama and those pushing for more comprehensive gun-control measures, the question will be how hard to push for items that are long shots at best. Reid looms at the end of all pathways, guarding his own red-state members in addition to his own constituents.\\nABC\\'s MICHAEL FALCONE: Hillary Clinton knows how to work a rope line. As First Lady, as a presidential candidate and even on her last day as Secretary of State, she\\'s proven it again and again. On Friday after offering brief farewell remarks at the State Department, she shook the hands of some of the several hundred employees who gathered to bid her farewell. A few even greeted her with a hand-made sign that read \"Thank You!\" And as ABC News State Department correspondent Dana Hughes noted, the crowd chanted, \"2016! 2016! We\\'ll miss you!\" as Clinton drove away. From Friday\\'s scene in Foggy Bottom to a campaign rally in Iowa or New Hampshire just a few years from now, it\\'s not a giant leap to picture what another Clinton presidential campaign might look like. And then there was at least one prominent Democratic senator\\'s not-so-subtle pitch for Clinton to run: \"If her future plans include seeking the Presidency,\" Missouri\\'s Claire McCaskill said in a statement on Friday, \"which I hope they do, then I look forward to being on her team and working my heart out to see her elected.\"\\nABC\\'s SHUSHANNAH WALSHE: President Obama heads to Minneapolis today to push his message of reducing gun violence. It comes after a weekend where we saw more devastating gun deaths. This time a high profile one that also calls into question mental health and post-traumatic stress disorder. Chris Kyle, known as the most lethal of snipers because of his target record, was more than just a good shot he was a mentor to troops returning home, especially those suffering from PTSD. He was doing just that on Saturday when the man he was trying to help turned his gun on him. It\\'s a devastating loss and one of several just this week, including the death of a young girl in Chicago who was only home a few days after performing at the president\\'s inauguration. Kyle\\'s killing calls into question the National Rifle Association chief\\'s statement after the tragedy in Newtown that \"the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\" Kyle was not just good, but great. It\\'s clear questions around guns, mental health, and the devastation of PTSD need to be answered.\\nVIDEO OF THE DAY: PRO-CLINTON SUPER PAC ALREADY UP AND RUNNING. Hillary Clinton had not even stepped down from her post as Secretary of State, when a superPAC supporting her run for president in 2016 was filed with the Federal Election Commission. The superPAC\\'s website launched over the weekend. Allida Black, who campaigned for Clinton in 14 states in 2008, is chair and founder of the group, and says she is, as the superPAC is named, \"Ready for Hillary.\" \"I\\'ve been waiting for Hillary all my life. But I am more than ready this time,\" Black told ABC\\'s Jonathan Karl for the latest edition of the ABC-Yahoo Power Players series, \"Politics Confidential.\" \"I have no doubt she\\'s gonna run,\" says Black. \"She knows there\\'s this huge groundswell. She sees the challenges. She\\'s not gonna say no. Not because of her, but because of us.\" WATCH: http://yhoo.it/UmH3YW\\nBUZZ\\nHARRY REID: BUDGET DEAL MUST INCLUDE REVENUE. Asserting that \"the American people\" are on his side, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told ABC\\'s George Stephanopoulos during an exclusive interview for \"This Week\" that any that deal reached between Republicans and Democrats to avoid the looming sequester must - \"without any question\" - include revenue. \"The American people are on our side. The American people don\\'t believe in these austere things. We believe that the rich should contribute. We believe we should fill those tax loopholes - get rid of them, I should say. And that\\'s where we need to go,\" Reid said. \"And I\\'ve got a pretty good fan base for that: the American people. Republicans, Democrats, and Independents.\" Reid confirmed his position on revenue would apply to any deal put into place to avert a government shutdown or lift the debt ceiling as well. This puts him directly at odds with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, who said earlier this month on \"This Week\" that the \"tax issue is finished,\" But Reid - invoking the GOP\\'s 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney - suggested a deal could include such things as the elimination of oil and gas subsidies, or what he called \"low hanging fruit.\" The Nevada senator also pushed back when I asked if he was sidelined during the so called \"fiscal cliff\" negotiations, telling me he played the \"bad cop\" during that period. http://abcn.ws/Wng3qU\\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT: Full transcript of Stephanopoulos\\' interview with Reid http://abcn.ws/12cK7cj and video http://abcn.ws/WK7Jyb\\nJORGE RAMOS: GOP FINALLY \\'GETTING IT\\' ON IMMIGRATION. Jorge Ramos, Univision anchor and host of the public affairs program, \"Al Punto,\" said \"I think Republicans are finally getting it,\" regarding the power of the Hispanic vote. Ramos joined ABC News in a web exclusive interview with ABC\\'s Kaye Foley before his appearance on the \"This Week\" roundtable on Sunday. With immigration at the forefront of the national conversation this week, Ramos discussed how supporting immigration reform can help Republicans, as well as his career influences, violence in Mexico, his upbringing, and his own journey to American citizenship. \"After the election, when they realized their candidate didn\\'t get 30 percent of the Hispanic vote, they understand that really they can\\'t make it without the Hispanic vote. Actually, no one can make it to the White House without the Hispanic vote. And - unless Republicans support immigration reform, it\\'s going to be impossible for them to get a high percentage of the Latino vote. So I think Latinos will recognize if they support immigration reform, but if many of them continue rejecting the idea that immigration reform is needed, it\\'s going to be very difficult for them to get the Hispanic vote and they\\'re going to lose the next election, and the next, and the next.\" http://abcn.ws/UPDDLY\\nIMMIGRATION REFORM: THE FOX NEWS FACTOR. In the brewing battle over a path to citizenship for the nation\\'s 11 million undocumented immigrants, Fox News Channel is uniquely positioned to play a make-or-break role. The question is, will it? Advocates on both sides of a proposed U.S. immigration overhaul are closely eyeing the nation\\'s most-watched cable news network - and megaphone - for politically-conservative causes as it joins a rapidly escalating national debate. Will the network and its high-profile opinionators fan the flames of opposition to a comprehensive reform plan, or will it assume a more neutral role in a debate that does not break cleanly along party lines? Rupert Murdoch, chairman and CEO at News Corp., Fox\\'s parent company, is the wild card factor in which way Fox News will go. Whether Murdoch\\'s personal views will percolate through his network, or at least temper criticism on the airwaves of those who don\\'t share it, remains to be seen. \"It depends on how prepared he is to muzzle people on Fox,\" said Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform and frequent Fox News guest, who opposes the widespread legalization proposed by President Obama and a bipartisan group of U.S. senators this week. Mehlman and other Republican critics of what they call an \"amnesty\" plan believe Fox News could be a crucial ally in the battle for public opinion on immigration. They credit Fox News with helping to amplify their message and derail a similar legislative push that was backed mostly by Democrats and President George W. Bush in 2006 and 2007. http://abcn.ws/WliM4k\\nIT\\'S NOT JUST GERALDO WHO\\'S EYING A NEW JERSEY SENATE SEAT\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Who\\'s the latest candidate to make some baby steps toward a run in New Jersey for U.S. Senate? \"Buckle your seat belts,\" as he told his radio listeners Thursday, its Fox News host and longtime media personality Geraldo Rivera. He went on Fox News Friday to explain the decision, saying he\\'s a Republican because of fiscal issues, not social ones. Rivera, 69, notes: \"I believe in immigration reform. I believe in gay rights and gay marriage. I believe in choice. Not obscenely, but I believe in Roe vs. Wade.\" And who are his possible opponents?

      "features:b'Carl Cameron reports from Capitol Hill\\nThe House approved a two-year spending plan on Thursday evening, in a strong bipartisan vote that underscored the desire by many lawmakers to avoid a repeat of the October budget showdown.\\nThe bill was approved 332-94, over the objections of conservatives concerned it would increase spending in the short-term and liberals concerned it would not extend long-term jobless aid.\\nThe bill now goes to the Senate. The House vote indicates the bill could be on a relatively clear path to the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desk, in sharp contrast to the protracted budget standoff in the fall which resulted in a partial government shutdown.\\nLawmakers face a Jan. 15 deadline this time around to approve a spending plan.\\nThe bill was approved with more Republican that Democratic votes. House Speaker John Boehner was among those voting yes -- notable because the speaker often does not vote.\\nAmong the 32 Democratic no&aposs was House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, reflecting a rare split in the Democratic leadership.\\nThe final breakdown was 169 Republicans and 163 Democrats voting yes and 62 Republicans and 32 Democrats voting no.\\nThe White House immediately issued a statement saying the bill&aposs passage \"marks an important moment of bipartisan cooperation and shows Washington can and should stop governing by crisis.\"\\nRep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., one of the bill&aposs chief negotiators, said it \"will stop Washington&aposs lurch from crisis to crisis.\" Rep. Patty Murray of Washington, the key negotiator on the Democratic side, echoed Ryan, saying, \"we are now one step closer to a bipartisan budget that would prevent another crisis.\"\\nAhead of the vote, Boehner sparred with the right flank of his party over the bill, produced out of weeks-long bipartisan negotiations. He specifically criticized conservative advocacy groups trying to pressure the rank-and-file to block the budget.\\n\"Frankly, I think they&aposre misleading their followers,\" Boehner said at a press conference. \"I think they&aposre pushing our members into places where they don&apost want to be. And frankly, I just think that they&aposve lost all credibility.\"\\nThe comments reflected a newly aggressive approach by Boehner, in contrast to the more conciliatory tone he took during the last budget showdown. The speaker even took a shot at them for fueling the last battle. \"You know, one of them, they pushed us into the fight to defund ObamaCare and shut down the government,\" he said.\\nFreedomWorks, among the groups that oppose the current budget bill, shot back at the House speaker again on Thursday.\\n\"Speaker Boehner may not care about what fiscally conservative groups do, but grassroots Americans still care about what he&aposs doing in Washington,\" FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe said in a statement. \"When it comes to &aposcredibility,&apos actions speak louder than words. And right now, it looks like the Speaker is leading the charge for spending increases and recruiting Democrat votes in the House to help get it done.\"\\nHouse GOP leaders argue that the bipartisan plan is a good deal for conservatives, since they claim it will shave $23 billion off the deficit over the next decade. However, it also erases $65 billion in sequester cuts in the near-term, and conservative groups are worried the long-term savings might never materialize.\\nWith the White House supporting the measure, GOP aides betrayed no nervousness about its chances for passage in the Republican-controlled House.\\nA Senate vote would likely wait until next week, and it was not yet clear whether Tea Party-aligned conservatives would require supporters to amass a 60-vote majority in order to pass it.\\nNobody was claiming that the pact was perfect. Some lawmakers said they were troubled by short-term increases in the deficit, $23.2 billion in 2014 and $18.2 billion the year after that.\\nBut the deal would put a dysfunctional Washington on track to prevent unappealing cuts to military readiness and weapons, as well as continued cuts to programs cherished by Democrats and Republicans alike, including health research, school aid, FBI salaries and border security. The cuts would be replaced with money from, among other things, higher airline security fees, curbs on the pension benefits of new federal workers or working-age military retirees, and premium increases on companies whose pension plans are insured by the federal government.\\nSen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, said that \"much of the spending increase in this deal has been justified by increased fees and new revenue. In other words, it&aposs a fee increase to fuel a spending increase, rather than reducing deficits.\"\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.' target:1\n",
      "features:b'WASHINGTON \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday that the use of chemical weapons in attacks on civilians in Syria last week was undeniable and that the Obama administration would hold the Syrian government accountable for a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmoral obscenity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that has shocked the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conscience.\\nIn some of the most aggressive language used yet by the administration, Mr. Kerry accused the Syrian government of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindiscriminate slaughter of civilians\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and of cynical efforts to cover up its responsibility for a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccowardly crime.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMr. Kerry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remarks at the State Department reinforced the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s toughening stance on the Syria conflict, which is now well into its third year, and indicated that the White House was moving closer to a military response in consultation with America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s allies.\\nAdministration officials said that although President Obama had not made a final decision on military action, he was likely to order a limited military operation \\xe2\\x80\\x94 cruise missiles launched from American destroyers in the Mediterranean Sea at military targets in Syria, for example \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and not a sustained air campaign intended to topple Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, or to fundamentally alter the nature of the conflict on the ground.\\nIn the coming days, officials said, the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intelligence agencies will disclose information to bolster their case that chemical weapons were used by Mr. Assad\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forces. The information could include so-called signals intelligence \\xe2\\x80\\x94 intercepted radio or telephone calls between Syrian military commanders.\\nOfficials said it was conceivable that military action could still be averted by a dramatic turnabout on the part of the Assad government, or by the Russian government that has been supporting it. But they said there were few expectations that this would happen.\\nAlthough the United States was consulting with allies, administration officials said they had largely abandoned hopes of obtaining any authorization for action in the United Nations Security Council, given the all-but certain veto from Russia.\\nIn a move that reflected its differences with the Kremlin over a possible American-led military operation against Syria, the Obama administration has decided to postpone a coming meeting with the Russians on the crisis. A Russian delegation had been scheduled to meet this week in The Hague with Wendy R. Sherman, the under secretary of state for political Affairs, and Robert S. Ford, the senior American envoy to the Syrian opposition, to discuss plans for a peace conference to end the fighting in Syria.\\nA senior State Department official said Monday night that the session would be postponed because of the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9congoing consultations about the appropriate response to the chemical weapons attack in Syria.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nOther signs of Western momentum toward a military response also took shape on Monday. Britain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prime minister, David Cameron, cut short a vacation to deal with Syria, and the foreign ministers of Britain and Turkey suggested that bypassing the United Nations Security Council was an option. France\\xe2\\x80\\x99s foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, said inaction was unacceptable.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe only option I do not envisage is to do nothing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Fabius told Europe 1, a French radio station. France has been a close ally of the rebels seeking Mr. Assad\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ouster in the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s civil war.\\nNews media in Cyprus, where Britain maintains a military air base that is less than 100 miles from Syria\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coast, reported stepped-up flights there in recent days, although such activity may not have been unusual.\\nMr. Kerry spoke hours after United Nations inspectors were finally allowed access to one of the attack sites, despite shooting from unidentified snipers that disabled their convoy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lead vehicle. The inspectors still managed to visit two hospitals, interview witnesses and doctors and collect patient samples for the first time since the attack last week that claimed hundreds of lives.\\nSecretary General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement after the assault that he had told his top disarmament official, Angela Kane, who was visiting Damascus, to register a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstrong complaint to the Syrian government and authorities of opposition forces\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to ensure the inspectors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 safety. There was no indication that any inspection team member had been hurt.\\nMr. Ban\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spokesman, Farhan Haq, told reporters at a regular daily briefing at United Nations headquarters in New York that the assailants, who had not been identified, fired on the first vehicle in the convoy, which was \\xe2\\x80\\x9chit in its tires and its front window.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUltimately,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit was not able to travel farther.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAntigovernment activists posted videos online of United Nations inspectors in blue helmets arriving in the Moadamiya area, southwest of the capital, where they were shown entering a clinic and interviewing patients.\\nThe visit by the United Nations inspectors to the Damascus suburb, in a half-dozen vehicles escorted by Syrian security forces, came shortly after Mr. Assad denied that his forces had used poison gas.\\nIn an interview with the Russian newspaper Izvestia, published on Monday, Mr. Assad said accusations that his forces had used chemical weapons were an \\xe2\\x80\\x9coutrage against common sense\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and warned the United States that military intervention in Syria would bring \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfailure just like in all the previous wars they waged, starting with Vietnam and up to the present day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nObama administration officials said that Mr. Kerry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement was calculated to rebut the claims made by Syria and its longtime patron, Russia, that the rebels were somehow responsible for the chemical weapons attack, or that Mr. Assad had made an important concession by giving the United Nations investigators access.\\nMr. Kerry said that on Thursday he told Walid al-Moallem, the Syrian foreign minister, that if the Assad government had nothing to hide it should provide immediate access to the attack site.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cInstead, for five days, the Syrian regime refused to allow the U.N. investigators access to the site of the attack that would allegedly exonerate them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Kerry said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInstead, it attacked the area further, shelling it and systematically destroying evidence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nFor Mr. Kerry, the denunciation of Mr. Assad carries a personal edge. As a senator in 2009, he met with Mr. Assad in Damascus to explore the possibility of building a more constructive relationship with Syria after a long chill. On Monday he accused him of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe indiscriminate slaughter of civilians.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nOn Capitol Hill, top House and Senate Republicans called on the administration to confer with lawmakers before any military strike and to make the case to a skeptical public. The White House on Monday reached out to Speaker John A. Boehner after Mr. Boehner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office noted publicly that he had not heard from the president on Syria.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe speaker made clear that before any action is taken there must be meaningful consultation with members of Congress, as well as clearly defined objectives and a broader strategy to achieve stability,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner.\\nOthers welcomed the signals from the administration that it was preparing to take action.

It never was,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Christopher Horner, a researcher who obtained the Obama administration email detailing Mr. Kutesa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stance. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll they want is wealth transfers, for the poor in rich countries to pay the rich in poor countries.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nNeither the Ugandan foreign ministry nor Mr. Stern returned emails seeking comment on the exchange, but the sentiment is echoed by all sides ahead of COP 21, the two-week meeting to hammer out a new global climate deal, which begins Monday in Paris.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEveryone knows that money will need to be on the table to seal the deal, but climate finance has been the biggest unknown in the lead-up to Paris,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Oxfam, a British-based nonprofit, said in a new report ahead of the meetings. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNegotiations on climate finance have been at a glacial pace, and only really began in earnest at the final negotiating session in October.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nOxfam said the $100 billion target for annual aid must be a floor, not a ceiling, and warned that the number could need to rise much higher if governments can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t agree to stricter emissions targets.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all a matter of math, the nonprofit said. The target was to reduce emissions enough so that the earth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s temperature would rise no more than 2 degrees Celsius \\xe2\\x80\\x94 leading to costs of about $1.6 trillion a year in both economic losses and adaptation costs.\\nBut current pledges would produce a rise of 3 degrees in world temperatures, which would add nearly $1 trillion to those annual costs, Oxfam calculates.

As a consequence, we cannot afford to lock in low ambition, and we cannot settle for a deal at any price,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Oxfam said.\\nNearly 150 heads of state will attend the Paris meeting, dubbed COP 21 because it is the 21st session of the Conference of Parties. Monday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opening ceremonies will be followed by two weeks of negotiations lasting six hours a day, broken into morning and afternoon sessions.\\nThe meeting comes as the World Meteorological Organization reported last week that the average global surface temperature in 2015 is likely to be the warmest recorded by humans, and will be 1 degree Celsius above the benchmark temperature before the industrial era.\\nA weather pattern known as El Nino is responsible for some of the warmth recorded this year, but the WMO scientists said 2011 to 2015 is the hottest five-year period on record, suggesting something more than weather is at work.\\nThe Paris gathering is seen as a chance for the world community to erase the failure of Copenhagen in 2009 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 COP 15 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which broke up in chaos, with major developing nations such as China and India refusing to agree to binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions.\\nThe climate fund is one way to try to get developing nations on board, but perhaps anticipating difficulties, Mr. Obama and other world leaders plan to announce a clean energy initiative, dubbed Mission Innovation, designed to double research and development on green energy projects.\\nMr. Obama himself will be in Paris only for several days, holding one-on-one meetings with key leaders such as Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But his personal involvement is likely to be derailed by the need to confront the resurgent Islamic State, which struck in horrific fashion in Paris just a few weeks ago.\\nInstead, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s his Cabinet officials who will do most of the heavy lifting: Secretary of State John F.

The courts appear likely to strike it down, the next president could tear it up, more than half of the 50 states have filed suit against it, and \\xe2\\x80\\x94 critically \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a bipartisan majority in both chambers of Congress just approved legislation to expressly reject it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. McConnell said.\\nOne test for the U.S. will be to see if Mr. Obama offers to up the U.S. pledge to the climate fund.\\nThe current pledge is for $3 billion \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the biggest share of the $10.2 billion in total world pledges, from 38 countries. But the U.S. hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t signed over any of its money yet, with Congress reluctant to carve that much money out of already-stretched discretionary budgets.\\nJapan is the second-largest contributor, having pledged $1.5 billion.

      "features:b'Unemployment Rising for Right Reasons\\nSolid job creation from the manufacturing sector last month bolstered U.S. employment growth.Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\\nMany analysts are viewing a slight uptick in the U.S. unemployment rate last month as a positive sign for the domestic economy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 suggesting more unemployed folks are coming off the sidelines and trying to land jobs.\\nAfter holding steady or falling for nine consecutive months, the unemployment rate ticked up to 4 percent last month, according to a jobs report published Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In May, U.S. unemployment dropped to 3.8 percent \\xe2\\x80\\x93 rarefied labor market territory that hasn\\'t been bested since the late 1960s.\\nRELATED CONTENT\\nFed Warns of Tariff Turmoil\\nAt the same time, however, labor force participation rose 0.2 percentage points \\xe2\\x80\\x93 indicative of more workers getting jobs or actively looking for work. Because of the way in which the government goes about calculating unemployment, those who aren\\'t actively looking for a job \\xe2\\x80\\x93 either because of retirement, higher education pursuits or simply because they\\'ve given up on trying to find a position \\xe2\\x80\\x93 don\\'t factor into standard unemployment percentages.\\nSo a slight increase in unemployment, coupled with the labor force rising by more than 600,000 people and participation inching up to 62.9 percent, is being viewed as a positive step forward.\\nEmployers, meanwhile, drummed up 213,000 new positions last month, which represents a slight downtick from May\\'s 244,000 additions but is still considered to be impressive this late into what is now the second-longest economic recovery on record. Retail woes resurfaced last month, with payrolls dropping by nearly 22,000 workers. But the sector\\'s struggles were offset by strong performances from professional and business services, health care and social assistance, and manufacturing employers.\\nAnd average hourly earnings ticked up 2.7 percent from where they sat a year ago \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a respectable pace but still slightly shy of the robust pay gains economists have predicted in light of the country\\'s general shortage of available skilled workers.\\nHere\\'s what some of the nation\\'s leading economists are saying about the June jobs report.\\nGus Faucher, senior vice president and chief economist at The PNC Financial Services Group\\n\"The unemployment rose to 4.0 percent in June from 3.8 percent in May, but for a good reason. More than 600,000 people entered the labor force in June to look for work, encouraged by the strong labor market,\" he said. \"The U.S. labor market is in excellent shape in mid-2018. Job growth is well above what is needed to keep up with new labor force entrants, and strong demand for workers and limited supply will continue to put upward pressure on wages.\"\\nMartha Gimbel, director of economic research at Indeed\\n\"While tariffs may slow down job growth moving forward, there is no sign yet in the June jobs report. With payroll job growth coming in at 213,000 (about typical for this recovery), this recovery continues on its record-breaking pace,\" she said. \"We just hit 93 straight months of job growth \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a new historical record. Notably, manufacturing job growth was strong in June, growing 3.5 percent at an annualized rate compared to its rate over the last year of 2.3 percent.\"\\nJim Baird, partner and chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors\\n\"If you\\'re looking for a good story in the June job report, you can certainly find it. If you\\'re looking for bad news, you\\'re probably able to find that as well,\" he said. \"There\\'s something for everyone to point to in support [of] either a glass half full or empty view; it really depends on how you choose to look at the glass.\"\\nEric Winograd, senior vice president and senior economist at AllianceBernstein\\n\"The top level takeaway is that the labor market remains consistent with robust economic growth but not yet tight enough to generate the kind of upward inflation pressures that would encourage the [Federal Reserve] to raise rates more rapidly,\" he said. \"Firms continue to hire workers but have not yet had to boost compensation per worker as much as would have been expected. While that is bad news for each worker, it does serve to limit the extent to which labor market tightness passes through to higher prices, which will allow the Fed to continue on its gradual path toward higher rates.\"\\nTendayi Kapfidze, chief economist at LendingTree\\n\"More construction is on the way. Construction jobs rose 13,000 in June,\" he said. \"Over the past year, 282,000 total construction jobs have been added as builders work to add supply given the tight inventory and rising home prices.\"\\nMark Hamrick, senior economic analyst and Washington bureau chief at Bankrate.com\\n\"Let\\'s remember that for some time, the unemployment rate has been below the level typically associated with \\'full employment,\\' but the relatively robust level of hiring being seen suggests there\\'s more room to the downside for the jobless rate,\" he said. \"For the Federal Reserve, this helps the central bank to avoid having a sense of alarm on the inflation issue. So, the Fed remains on track to boost rates 1 or 2 times between now and the end of the year.\"\\nAndrew Soergel, Senior Reporter\\nAndrew Soergel is a Senior Reporter at U.S. News.

The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury dipped as well, a sign that the bond market does not believe the Fed is going to make any big moves just yet.\\n\"Yellen is looking at trends. The Fed is not going to be terribly reactive to one month of data,\" said Chris Molumphy, chief investment officer of Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group. He added that there would need to be at least two more months of subpar jobs growth before the Fed -- and consumers and investors -- should be worried about the economy.\\nRelated: 5 big trends shaking up the job market\\nBut it\\'s not all bad news. The economy has averaged nearly 220,000 jobs added a month, and the payroll gains were revised higher for both June and July.\\nOne expert said that it\\'s important to remember that the August number could eventually change as well -- for the better.\\n\"This number will be revised higher. August is the quirkiest month,\" said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist with Federated Investors. \"This is inconsistent with strength we\\'re seeing elsewhere in the economy.\"\\nRecall that the government originally reported that zero (that\\'s right, zilch) new jobs were added in August 2011. The number wound up getting revised sharply higher a couple of months later.\\nRelated: Unemployment rates by state\\nBeyond the headlines: Hourly wages rose slightly. They are up 2.1% over the past 12 months. However, that\\'s only slightly higher than the inflation rate. So workers won\\'t feel much better off.\\nThere were solid job gains in several industries that tend to pay well, such as business and professional services and health care. Jobs were added in the construction sector as well, a possible sign that the housing market is continuing to bounce back.\\nJohn Canally, chief economic strategist for LPL Financial, noted that weakness in the manufacturing and retail sectors, dragged down overall job growth. He said there may be some strange seasonal, end-of-summer factors to explain that.\\nRelated: College grads are underemployed, but a degree is still worth it\\n\"My view of the job market is unchanged from where it was before this report came out. This is an anomaly,\" Canally said.\\nStill, there were other lackluster signs in the job report. The so-called \"underemployment rate,\" which counts discouraged workers who have given up looking for jobs and people working part-time who would rather have a full-time job, is 12%. That\\'s down from July but still nearly double the official unemployment rate.\\nAnd the labor force participation rate, which measures how many people of working age are actually in the job market, remained near its lowest levels in more than 35 years. That\\'s a function of more and more people, particularly women and retiring baby boomers, dropping out of the work force.\\nThe political reaction: U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez noted in a statement Friday morning that the private sector has now added jobs for 54 consecutive months. That\\'s the longest streak ever.\\nBut he added that \"there are still 3 million long-term unemployed Americans, and we can do more to help those who are still struggling to recover.\" He reiterated President Obama\\'s call to Congress to raise the minimum wage.\\nHouse Speaker John Boehner did not address the minimum wage issue in his own statement.

      "features:b'Since Wednesday morning, Democrats in the House have been sitting on their butts and accomplishing nothing of value. So, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re basically doing what they normally do, but this time without chairs.\\n[mattwalsh-social-instory]\\nThe purpose of their \\xe2\\x80\\x9csit in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is to push gun control and protest gun violence. Of course, if they really wanted to protest gun violence by lounging on the floor, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d think they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d at least choose a floor in Chicago or West Baltimore. But that may be too dangerous, perhaps less sanitary, and it would likely call attention to the most politically inconvenient kind of gun violence. That is, the kind that takes place between minorities in areas where extraordinarily strict gun laws are already on the books.\\nNo, we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about that. Democrats would rather sit and sulk on the floor of the House instead. Fortunately, a couple of hours into it, a woman came in with juice boxes and read them a story before nap time. There was an adorable moment where Rep. John Yarmuth fell asleep sucking his thumb, but was woken suddenly when Rep. John Larson accidentally peed his pants and started crying. At that point they were all too riled up to sleep so Rep. John Lewis led the gang in a rousing game of Duck, Duck, Goose.\\nNow, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say for sure that all of that actually happened. But the part where a bunch of elderly statesmen sat Indian style on the floor and pouted for the cameras definitely did happen, so the rest may as well have. It went on for hours as anxious onlookers prayed that an actual adult might show up to give them a good talking-to and send them to bed without supper. At the time of this writing they are still on the floor, still sitting, still demonstrating their dignified resolve by playing on their phones, posing for selfies and tweeting congratulations to themselves. And all the while, taxpayers work real jobs in order to pay the salaries of a bunch of showboating buffoons.\\nThe average taxpayer may not be too pleased to see his lawmakers carrying on this way, but the lawmakers are certainly quite impressed with it themselves. It seems they can hardly contain their self-admiration. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is what courage looks like,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d read the caption of a photograph of several overpaid politicians relaxing on the carpet. Many liberals on social media agreed, exclaiming that the protest was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cheroic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbrave\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9chistoric\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and so on. Whatever other cause these \\xe2\\x80\\x9cactivists\\xe2\\x80\\x9d wanted to call attention to, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clear that their primary mission was to courageously make sure that everyone knew how courageously courageous they really are.\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll notice that liberals are constantly informing us that their behavior is brave. This, by the way, is the quickest way to confirm that someone is not brave. The doer of truly brave deeds doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pause in the midst of his bravery to say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook how brave I am.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what frauds and charlatans do. And these Democrats are nothing if they are not frauds and charlatans. What else can you call a person who stands on the graves of 49 dead Americans to extol his own virtue?\\nAs a general rule, actions that are comfortable, politically advantageous, sure to win you praise from the media, and requiring no sacrifice on your part are not brave. At a minimum, bravery entails making it through one night without pizza, Dunkin Donuts, Chick-fil-A, and pillows and blankets, but these fearless warriors couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even accomplish that. A truly brave man stands up for truth in the face of opposition. A lazy opportunist sits on a cushy pillow with snacks and a smart phone, tweeting popular slogans while the media cheers him on. Most crucially, a brave man is honest and sincere in his actions. And that is where Democrats fail the brave test most spectacularly.\\nThey waited until now, right when they have a mass tragedy to exploit and an election to win, to push for this \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccommon sense gun reform.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Curiously, however, when they owned the House, Senate and Presidency in 2008, they made no effort to pass legislation that could, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve just decided, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csave thousands of lives.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That could be because Obama was still selling guns to Mexican drug cartels back in those days, so perhaps they thought the subject a little awkward.\\nIt would have taken real courage to stand up to the Democrat president and demand he be brought to justice for funneling weapons into the hands of dangerous people. But Democrats never have courage in the moments where courage is actually required. Like true heroes, they remained silent and waited until they had a Republican majority to blame and a tragedy to utilize.\\nFrauds and charlatans, as I said. Liars. Hucksters. Performance artists. And, we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget, tyrants.\\nIf we can look past the insincerity of this whole charade, the actual laws they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trying to push deserve some attention. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say this for sure, but I believe this may be the first recorded case of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccivil rights sit in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d being staged for the purpose of revoking civil rights. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s especially ironic considering the bills these Democrats are courageously championing would especially harm people of color. Rep. John Lewis once fought to win due process rights for racial minorities, and now he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fighting to take them back. An incredible development.\\nThe Democrat temper tantrum centers around four gun control bills that were rejected by the Senate this week. The bills would intrude upon Second Amendment rights in various ways, but their primary function would be to deny guns to anyone on the No Fly List or the Terror Watchlist or the Might Be Bad Guys List or whatever other secret government list.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get on a plane, you shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to buy a gun,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the bizarre and popular mantra goes. One wonders when we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll start extending this to other disconnected things. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t drive a car, you shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to practice religion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t procure a liquor license, you shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to assemble peacefully.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Etc.\\nYou see how this works, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you? Take something we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a constitutional right to \\xe2\\x80\\x94 planes, for instance \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and tie it to something we do have a constitutional right to, like guns. Just like that, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve erased a right by conflating it with something that is not a right. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve allowed the government to prevent you from exercising a right with the same ease that it can prevent you from exercising a privilege. And once you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done that, the process will not stop until there is no discernible legal distinction between a right and a privilege.\\nThis is troubling because all the government has to do to put you on a list is put you on a list. They have to open a computer document, type your name, save it, and then forward it to all of the relevant government agencies. Whatever else goes into it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 if anything else goes into it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is muddled, unclear, and largely classified. Most people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even find out they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re on the No Fly List until they try to board a plane. And most of those people have no idea how to get themselves off of it once they discover that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been placed on it.\\nBut these new gun control measures would not be confined to lists. Under legislation proposed by Senator Dianne Feinstein, anyone can be denied their Second Amendment rights if the Attorney General says so:\\nThe amendment Feinstein introduced last Wednesday\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 lets the attorney general block a sale if he \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdetermines, based on the totality of the circumstances, that the transferee represents a threat to public safety based on a reasonable suspicion that the transferee is engaged, or has been engaged, in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism, or providing material support or resources thereof.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6There is no additional requirement that the attorney general have reason to believe the weapon the suspect is trying to buy will be used in a terrorist attack. Hence an old lady who cut a check to a Hamas-affiliated charity (thereby \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproviding material support\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to terrorism and arguably threatening public safety) could be stopped from buying a handgun for self-defense even if there was no evidence that she planned any sort of attack with it.\\nMagnanimously, Democrats would allow those summarily charged and convicted of future crimes by the Attorney General, or anyone on any secret list \\xe2\\x80\\x94 should they accidentally find out that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re on a secret list \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to plead their case in hopes of reclaiming their rights. It will be akin to waking up in jail one day and being told that you have to prove you aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t guilty before they let you out. But of course, first you have to figure out what crime you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re accused of committing, or of thinking about committing, which is a detail they may not be able to share given the classified nature of the investigation. So you must prove you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do whatever thing they think you did, or that you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do whatever thing they think you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re about to do, and then maybe, after a certain amount of time, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll grant you access to the entire Bill of Rights again. Or maybe not. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s up to the Attorney General.\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what Democrats are \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfighting\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to achieve. And it should be of interest to the almost 1,000,000 people on the various lists in question, many of whom are probably brown-skinned Muslims of Arabic descent.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not just the Second Amendment at stake here. The Fourth and Fifth Amendments exist also, or so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard. These amendments, located just two and three steps away from the Second, respectively, guarantee that a person will not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process. They stipulate that the law may not treat someone as a convicted criminal until that individual has actually been, you know, convicted of a crime.\\nAs much as some of us may love the First and Second Amendments, these other two are rather important because without them the First and Second are meaningless. The Amendments all work together like notes in a piece of music. If you take away one or two of the notes, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve fundamentally changed, and probably destroyed, the entire song.\\nIf you have the right to bear arms, but the government has the right to take that right away just by snapping its fingers, then you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the right to bear arms. Or \\xe2\\x80\\x9chaving the right\\xe2\\x80\\x9d becomes such an impotent and toothless concept that we may as well burn the whole document and carry on without it.\\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the thing: the folks on the various watch lists are not charged and convicted terrorists. If they were, they wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be on a list, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be in jail. Being on the list just means someone in the government thinks you might be a terrorist, or thinks you might become a terrorist. Or it could just mean that the government doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like you or your ideas very much. Remember, this is the same government that considers Catholics and Evangelical Christians to be dangerous extremist groups.\\nThis is why our whole system of rights and liberties rests on the fact that the government can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t deprive you of your rights and liberties just because it thinks you might be a threat. Your human rights are not meant to be contingent upon the whims and suspicions and prejudices of bureaucrats. The government has to prove its case. Yes, that may be hard, but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s their job. They should quit whining, take responsibility for their incompetency, and stop trying to blame the Constitution for their countless failures.\\nThis is not a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cslippery slope\\xe2\\x80\\x9d into the revocation of the entire Bill of Rights. It is, itself, a revocation of the entire Bill of Rights. Democrats, naked and unapologetic tyrants as they are, like to refer to the fact that people on lists can buy weapons as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cloophole.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Our Founders had a name for this loophole: the Constitution.\\nAs usual, I find myself siding with the Founders on this one. They were the truly brave heroes. These Democrats are just petty despots sitting on the floor.\\nTo request Matt for speaking engagement, contact Clint or Matt at Outreach Speakers.

It also said more than half of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ownership should rest with five or fewer people, with all members of a single family being treated as an individual.\\nA company that meets this definition can opt out by adopting a resolution and then notifying either HHS or their insurer or third-party administrator of their formal objections.

      "features:b'Paul Ryan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new crackdown against protests on the House floor \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a direct response to the Democrats\\xe2\\x80\\x99 gun-control \\xe2\\x80\\x9csit-in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d last summer \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is prompting questions from experts in both parties about its constitutionality.\\nAs part of a House rules package members will vote to approve in early January, House GOP leaders want to empower the sergeant-at-arms to fine lawmakers up to $2,500 for shooting video or taking photos on the chamber floor.\\nStory Continued Below\\nBut experts say Ryan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proposal may run afoul of Article 1 of the Constitution, which says \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceach House may \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 punish its Members for disorderly behavior.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d For more than 200 years that has been interpreted to mean any contested sanctions against lawmakers must be approved by the full House with a floor vote, attorneys steeped in congressional legal matters say.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Constitution gives the House the authority to discipline members; I have never heard of anything where an officer of the House was given that authority,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mike Stern, a former lawyer for the nonpartisan House counsel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office and the Senate Homeland Security Committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GOP staff.\\nStern, who called the proposed rule a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cplausible Constitutional issue to raise,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Democrats could take the matter to court. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTheir strongest argument would be: The House doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the authority to give these officers the power to punish us; only the power of the House can do that, and [Republicans] have short-circuited our rights by the way they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done it.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nHouse rules prohibit taking video or photos of the floor. But Democrats defied those restrictions in June, using their cellphones to live-stream a 25-hour protest triggered by Ryan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s refusal to allow a gun-control vote.\\nAfter Democrats seized the floor and refused to yield, Republicans shut down the chamber. C-SPAN had been airing the demonstration, but its cameras, which are controlled by the House majority, were turned off when the House shut down. The network then picked up a cellphone live-stream from one of the lawmakers protesting.\\nRepublicans were incensed by the entire spectacle. For months GOP leaders met privately to craft a plan to either punish lawmakers who led the charge or write new rules to deter a similar future hijacking of legislative business. That led to Ryan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current proposal.\\nAs Democrats blasted the new rule Tuesday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and lawyers representing the Democratic minority began examining its legality. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are reviewing this language as it appears to raise constitutional concerns,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill told POLITICO in an email Tuesday.\\nSome Democrats are itching for a fight over the rule. Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), one of the leaders of last summer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s protest, tweeted at Republicans to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbring it on\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and dared them to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfine me & @HouseDemocrats all the way into bankruptcy for #gunviolence sit-in, but we will always speak for victims.\"\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf they cut the camera feed again, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to turn on my phone again,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Swalwell vowed during a brief interview Tuesday.\\nRyan\\'s spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, dismissed the notion that the rule might be unconstitutional. Strong said the changes \"will help ensure that order and decorum are preserved in the House\" and pointed to existing automatic penalties for members who fail to file financial disclosure paperwork on time to argue that it\\'s not unprecedented. (That $200 penalty, imposed by the bipartisan ethics panel, was instituted in law to ensure members don\\'t hide unlawful conflicts of interest.)\\nAt the crux of the debate is a question of whether the House can delegate punishment authority. Lawmakers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work for party leadership or House administrative staff; they work for themselves and their constituents. So the question of docking pay is a tricky one on Capitol Hill.\\nTypically, ethical issues regarding lawmakers are referred to the House Ethics Committee, a bipartisan panel split evenly between Democrats and Republicans that can recommend sanctions against a member. If a lawmaker protests the sanctions, the matter goes to the full House floor. The body then decides with a vote whether the member is guilty and should be punished.\\nRyan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan to essentially designate that power to the sergeant-at-arms \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccould be a problem,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Stan Brand, a former longtime House counsel for the Democrats.\\nDuring his stint on Capitol Hill, Brand said he litigated a dispute surrounding a century-old statute that barred members from taking pay for days they weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t working. But while the statute gave the sergeant-at-arms the authority to deduct member pay, he \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnever did,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Brand said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbecause he never felt he had the power to do it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBrand said the sergeant-at-arms doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have as many legal protections as lawmakers and could actually be sued by House members should they feel he unlawfully deducted their pay. Brand said it would be better if Republicans simply used their own authority to punish members with a House vote \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpass on their dirty work,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as he put it, to nonpartisan House staff.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the House that has the power, the self-disciplinary authority, to do this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Brand said, noting that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s never been tested in court. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure they can delegate the disciplinary power to an individual house officer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nRobert Walker, former chief counsel and staff director to the Senate and House ethics panels, did not think Republicans would run afoul of the Constitution with the new rule. But he nonetheless wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sure it was a good idea because it could open the door to the House delegating other duties to officers.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo members really want to start this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnce you start delegating punishment to an officer, it raises a question of precedent and whether it can be expanded, and I think members will want to think carefully before they do this.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWalker also noted that members don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t appear to have a venue to appeal the verdict: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat happens when there is a difficult circumstance and one of the members thinks there ought to be a right to appeal? Maybe you add that to the rule: a right to appeal. Members ought to have procedural rights as well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nRepublicans could recraft the proposal to alleviate such concerns, but that might ultimately defeat their initial intent: deterring Democrats from future occupations of the chamber.\\nOne option could be to have the ethics panel serve as an appeals panel. But, as Stern notes, the committee \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctakes forever\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to litigate so \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it would be as much of a deterrent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The panel is also evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, potentially allowing the minority to block a punishment.\\nRepublicans could also amend the rule to force the House to vote to approve the sanctions on members. But that, in theory, would allow Democrats to continue the public spectacle Republicans are trying to quash, giving them an even larger platform for their cause.\\n\"Look, I understand the Republicans are trying not to inflame things by coming up with something to put a stop on [this protesting], but there is no way around them exercising their own authority to control breeches of decorum,\" Brand said. \"That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way do it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not by delegating it to some poor officer of the House.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nJohn Bresnahan contributed to this report.' target:-1\n",

They have proven to be by far the strongest fighting force in northern Iraq.\\nFrom a hilltop overlooking Mosul in October, peshmerga commanders showed Williams territory they\\'d clawed back from the extremists.\\nBut as members of an ethnic minority, Kurdish fighters will be viewed as foreign invaders if they try to recapture Mosul alone, and earlier this month their commanders told us they\\'re still massively outgunned by ISIS.\\n\"ISIS seized weapon from both Syria and the Iraqi army,\" said Kurdish national security adviser Masrour Barzanib. \"We are talking about at least 1,500 Humvees, we are talking about 155 Howitzers... we are talking about armored vehicles, we are talking about tanks, heavy machine guns, loads of ammunition.\"\\nAll the type of equipment Barzani said he has repeatedly requested from his allies in Washington, but has yet to receive.\\nIf the Mosul offensive does go ahead in the spring, it\\'s still not clear whether it would involve U.S. military advisers who are already on the ground in Iraq.\\nAlso important to note, the CENTCOM official who spoke to reporters Thursday about the plans for the offensive said it was possible the operation could be delayed, if the Iraqi forces weren\\'t deemed up to muster by the April or May target.\\nAs for why the U.S. military was taking the unusual step of telegraphing its intentions to the enemy, the official said he wanted to describe the sort of military commitment the Iraqis had made to defeating ISIS.\\nAs CBS News senior defense correspondent David Martin reported, however, \"it also seems to be a form of psychological warfare against those ISIS fighters holding Mosul.\"' target:-1\n",

Utilizing social media platforms presents a major revolution in the way people interact, but in turn, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a growing cause of concern for traditional media outlets.\\nIt can be argued that every presidential election since Barack ObamaBarack Hussein ObamaObama recently gave speech at Boeing retreat: report New poll shows Speaker Pelosi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approval rating down during government shutdown Andrew McCarthy: Stone indictment makes clear there was no Trump-Russia conspiracy MORE\\xe2\\x80\\x99s win in 2008 was won on social media platforms \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the candidate that was able to better utilize these platforms took out the election.

For many, embracing change and applying social media outreach to a traditional advocacy campaign is foreign to them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe Trump administration was quick to harness the power of social media, and it has been said within political circles that it utilized social media aggressively \\xe2\\x80\\x94 micro-targeting different audiences with opposite messages without disclosing itself as the source of the promotional information.\\nFor example, on Election Day, potential Trump voters were told that the election was very close and they needed to go out and vote, while potential Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonHillicon Valley: US files criminal charges against Huawei | Facebook unveils new plans to crack down on misinformation | Ocasio-Cortez hits tech giants over event with climate skeptics House Dems unveil initial GOP targets in 2020 The Hill's 12:30 Report: Funding talks, round two | Trump says another shutdown 'certainly' possible | Trump mocks Starbucks CEO over 2020 talk MORE voters were told the opposite: that it was in the bag and there was no need to worry.\\nOn the one hand, the use of social media as a political tool can improve citizen-government engagement, allowing constituencies to feel as though they are involved and that their voice is being heard, says Anthes, who also states that it serves as a tool to build awareness for issues and enables individuals to influence the public conversation in a targeted, hyper-local way. Social media can rally public sentiment and support for political campaigns in a way that is constantly changing.\\nThat said, governments and politicians alike must understand the importance of tracking social media sentiment and keeping up to speed with trending topics to ensure an alignment with what the masses deem worthy of consumption. Despite the tremendous opportunity it presents, very few political candidates and government agencies use social media effectively.\\nUnlike brands, they seem to flock to traditional, familiar channels instead of building their online presence. Brands across verticals from fashion to food are utilizing influencers as advocates in a bid to reach their interested, engaged and loyal audiences. SociallyMined shared with us that it has been speaking with politicians across the board, who are amassing armies of micro-influencers that share an ideological connection with them and their policies so they can utilize them in their next elections.\\nMost politicians, unless they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re very well known, will have a relatively small following on social media and a comparatively mundane online presence. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t utilize much technology to understand their audience.\\nAdvocacy experts believe that this mentality needs to change; the ones refusing to adapt will be left behind.

Simple mistakes like \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccovfefe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d can lead to weeks of ridicule, and there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always a plethora of people waiting for the next slip-up. On the other hand, a simple statement like Clinton's \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdelete your account\\xe2\\x80\\x9d can win a candidate significant points in an online debate.\\nElected officials should strategically utilize social media as a way to communicate with their constituent base and keep them informed of issues as they arise.

      "features:b'WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama chastised Senate Republicans on Friday for refusing to confirm his attorney general nominee, saying it\\'s inexcusable to hold Loretta Lynch \"hostage\" as a bargaining chip for separate legislation.\\n\"You don\\'t hold attorney general nominees hostage for other issues,\" Obama told The Huffington Post\\'s Sam Stein in a sit-down interview. \"This is our top law enforcement office. Nobody denies that she\\'s well-qualified. We need to go ahead and get her done.\"\\nLynch\\'s nomination has been languishing for more than 130 days. This week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) threw up another roadblock, warning that she wouldn\\'t get a vote until his chamber passes human trafficking legislation. Democrats object to anti-abortion language in the bill.\\nThe president\\'s comments were essentially a call to arms to Senate Democrats to stand firm rather than surrender to the hostage-takers, i.e., Senate Republicans, on the trafficking bill.\\nOn Wednesday, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) went after his GOP colleagues for the delay in voting on Lynch, suggesting that they were treating her differently because of her race.\\n\"Loretta Lynch, the first African-American woman nominated to be attorney general, is asked to sit in the back of the bus when it comes to the Senate calendar,\" said Durbin. \"That is unfair. It\\'s unjust. It is beneath the decorum and dignity of the U.S. Senate.\"\\n\"I think race certainly can be considered a major factor in the delay,\" said Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.), chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, on Tuesday.\\nObama, however, was less convinced about Republican motivations.\\n\"I don\\'t know about that,\" the president said on Friday, referring to the role that race may have played in delaying Lynch\\'s confirmation. Instead, he pointed to \"Senate dysfunction\" and \"stubbornness on the part of Republicans to move nominees, period.\"\\n\"What I do know is that she is eminently qualified. Nobody denies it,\" Obama said. \"Even the Republicans acknowledge she\\'s been a great prosecutor. She has prosecuted terrorists in New York, she has gone after organized crime, she\\'s gone after public corruption. Her integrity is unimpeachable. By all accounts, she\\'s a great manager, and the fact that she has now been lingering in this limbo for longer than the five previous attorney general nominees combined makes no sense. We need to go ahead and get this done.\"\\nAttorney General Eric Holder also dismissed the idea of race playing into the holdup during an MSNBC interview Friday.\\n\"My guess is that there is probably not a huge racial component to this, that this is really just D.C. politics, Washington at its worst,\" he said. \"A battle about something that is not connected to this nominee, holding up this nominee. I think that\\'s the main driver here.\"\\nLynch, currently the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, received a bipartisan boost Friday, when former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R) called on Republicans to stop stalling her confirmation.\\nThe president confirmed Friday that Holder, who has long been the target of GOP lawmakers\\' ire, has agreed to stay on as attorney general until his replacement is set.\\n\"The irony is, of course, that the Republicans really dislike Mr. Holder,\" said Obama. \"If they really want to get rid of him, the best way to do it is to go ahead and get Loretta Lynch confirmed.\"\\nThe Huffington Post\\xe2\\x80\\x99s full interview with President Obama will be published on Saturday.

      "features:b'LAS VEGAS, NEVADA \\\\-- He needed a game-changing performance. He didn\\'t deliver one. Advantage, Hillary. Some thoughts:\\n(1) At the risk of being accused of homerism (disclosure: I\\'m a Fox News contributor), Chris Wallace was superb in his moderating duties last night. He eschewed the temptation to come barging out of the gate with questions about salacious news cycle-driven dramas, opting to save \"fitness to be president\" themes for much later in the evening. He led with issues. This was a debate that primarily focused on issues. The Fox News Sunday host held each candidate to account for the proposals they\\'ve put forward, and the things they\\'ve said. He pressed Trump for specifics. He challenged Clinton with honed evidence. He was tough on both of them, directed the (sometimes wild) rhetorical traffic with laudable poise, and afforded the candidates a fairly wide berth to engage each other, but without allowing the exchanges to spin out of control. A-plus work. And I\\'d be saying the same thing if he worked for another network.\\n(2) Hillary Clinton began the night with a breathtaking mischaracterization of the Supreme Court\\'s Heller decision on guns, and whitewashing her extreme stance on abortion as if it were perfectly normal -- as opposed to radically out of step with most voters. Alas, because Trump was under-prepared to correct and clarify on both issues, most viewers probably thought she \"won\" that segment. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court is the top reason for conservatives to oppose her. On immigration, she complained that her Wikileaks-provided \"open borders\" speech excerpt was taken out of context. The problem? She\\'s withheld the transcripts of her Wall Street addresses, which makes her dings on Trump\\'s hidden tax returns less impactful. She much preferred talk about Russian meddling in the election to the content of the leaks -- and Trump probably helped her by refusing to accept Russian guilt as a fact, which our intelligence says it is. As a result, her slams on him for being a Russian puppet had some bite. Her economic answers were dull, predictable, and full of lefty tropes and poll-tested buzz phrases. She pressed her toughest case against Trump\\'s temperament, drawing some blood throughout that extended back-and-forth, I suspect. Her \"horrifying\" denunciation of his refusal to pledge to accept the election results (more on that later) was a memorable moment that will get a lot of play, and her rundown of all the times Trump has screamed \"rigged!\" was powerful. (Trump\\'s interjection about The Apprentice deserving an Emmy was genuinely funny, and she almost laughed). One assertion she issued at least three times is that she will not add \"a penny\" to the national debt. This is absolutely, positively ludicrous and false. GOP ad-makers should already be saving those clips for 2020, assuming she wins. That pledge will be broken on day one.\\n(3) Trump was subdued and controlled at the beginning, hitting his talking points on guns and abortion, but allowing her to control both topics. He rebounded in the immigration segment, his comfort zone. The press room groaned and gasped at the \"bad hombres\" line, but he was obviously talking about illegal immigrants who\\'ve committed violent felonies on our soil. I think he won that skirmish. In general, Trump counter-punched throughout the evening, with mixed results. One of his better moments was challenging Hillary to return Clinton Foundation cash donated by misogynistic and homophobic regimes. He pointedly asked whether she\\'d do so, then rambled on too long, distracting himself with another point. She never answered. He let her off the hook. Trump\\'s blanket denials of all the sexual misconduct allegations against him were not credible, and his mentions of the Project Veritas videos (as we predicted) were insufficiently explanatory. At the very least, he may have driven Google traffic to that investigation from curious debate viewers. Though she was much more fluid and informed on foreign policy than he was, Trump got some good jabs in about her record. His effective message: How do you expect this person to fix the mess we face when she\\'s been at or near the center of US power for decades, and she\\'s contributed to the mess? Her failures and unlikeability kept him in the game.\\n(4) Despite again communicating in his patented sentence-fragment-sprinkled word salad, I think he probably battled Clinton to an approximate draw for most of the debate. The big exception was the \"fitness for office\" stretch. She clearly won that exchange, and his decision to repeatedly equivocate on accepting the electoral outcome in November (the \"leave you in suspense\" line felt flat and felt cheap) will dominate a lot of the coverage for the next few days. Trump surrogates will respond with the parable of Al Gore, who dragged the 2000 election out for weeks on end, arguing in court for partial, cherry-picked recounts of counties that he thought could tip Florida\\'s overall tally into his column. (He lost, no matter how you slice it). But Clinton defenders will say that Gore didn\\'t call the legitimacy of the process into question prior to the voting ending, and only pursued a recount under very unusual circumstances. There\\'s a difference between not conceding an historically close election, and baselessly alleging widespread fraud in advance. Both sides will have their talking points on this, but I\\'d guess the American people want to hear their candidates promise to honor the process. Even Trump loyalists like Laura Ingraham quickly conceded this point. And if CBS News\\' Luntz focus group -- which split almost right down the middle for Trump and Clinton overall -- is any indication, Trump\\'s \"rigged\" flirtations on stage hurt him:\\nRecommended\\nFact Check: Yes, the Overwhelming Majority of Americans Got a Tax Cut Under the GOP-Passed Law\\nGuy Benson\\n> Voters want the candidates to support the election results.

Chris Wallace laid out the mathematical reality very succinctly. Donald Trump pretended the problem will be solved with magical economic growth. Hillary Clinton talked about taxing the rich and expanding entitlements. Neither of these people is remotely serious about the wave of debt (fueled historically during the Obama era) that is building, and that non-partisan bookkeepers keep warning will swamp us.

      "features:b'Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday took on Republican congressional critics of her department\\'s handling of the deadly September terrorist attack in Libya.\\nConservative GOP members challenged Clinton on the lack of security at the diplomatic compound in Benghazi as well as the erroneous account that the attack grew spontaneously from a protest over an anti-Islam film produced in the United States.\\nAt two hearings, which together totaled more than five hours, Clinton acknowledged a \"systemic breakdown\" cited by an independent review of issues leading up to the armed assault and said her department was taking additional steps to increase security at U.S. diplomatic facilities.\\nHere are five things we learned from the hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs committees.\\nRead more: Clinton takes on Benghazi critics\\n1\\\\. What Clinton did the day of the Benghazi attack\\nClinton spent the better part of last September 11 trying to get a handle on security at several other U.S. embassies in the Middle East where anti-American protests were in full swing over an anti-Muslim film produced in the United States.\\nShe said the U.S. embassy was \"under assault\" by crowds trying to scale the wall. American embassies in Yemen and Tunisia were also facing a \"serious threat. Clinton personally called the president of Tunisia, she said, to \"beg him to send reinforcements, which he did, to finally save our embassy.\"\\nBy 4 p.m. that day, Clinton was notified about the Benghazi attack. In the coming hours, she was in meetings and spoke with staff, the American Embassy in Tripoli and other U.S. officials.\\nDirecting the U.S. response from the State Department, Clinton stayed in touch with officials across the administration and with the Libyan government.\\nShe instructed her staff to \"consider every option, to just break down the doors of the Libyan officials to get as much security support as we possibly could.\"\\nClinton said in the hours and days following the attack in Benghazi, there were \"no delays in decision-making. No denials of support from Washington or from our military,\" something an independent board established to review the matter cited in its report.\\n#whatdifferencedoesitmake: Clinton quote goes viral on Twitter\\n2\\\\. U.S. diplomatic posts in some 20 countries under threat\\nClinton said threats to U.S. diplomatic posts are ongoing.\\n\"Sitting here today, we probably have at least 20 other posts that are under a serious threat environment as I speak to you,\" she told senators. \"We operate in places where we know that our facilities are being surveilled for potential attacks where we have a steady Intel stream of plotting.\"\\nClinton detailed what the State Department has done to begin implementing the 29 recommendations of the Accountability Review Board to improve security at diplomatic posts in high-threat areas, in addition to a few of her own.\\nOpinion: Benghazi blame game is useless\\nSpecifically, Clinton has appointed a team, led by her deputy, to focus on tightening security, sent joint teams of military special forces and diplomatic security threat analysts to more than a dozen high-risk posts and appointed a senior official to focus exclusively on those areas.\\nThe State Department is also working to streamline requests for security so they make their way more quickly up the chain of leadership.\\nDespite the threat, Clinton stressed the importance of U.S. leadership and diplomatic presence in the Middle East.\\n\"We\\'ve come a long way in the past four years, and we cannot afford to retreat now,\" Clinton told senators. \"When America is absent, especially from unstable environments, there are consequences. Extremism takes root, our interests suffer, our security at home is threatened.\"\\nRead more: Pentagon releases official timeline of Benghazi attack\\n3\\\\. Clinton not shying away from a fight\\nClinton grew emotional and held back tears when talking about U.S. personnel killed in the Benghazi attack.\\n\"For me, this is not just a matter of policy, it\\'s personal. I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews,\" Clinton said as she choked back tears. \"I put my arms around the mothers and fathers, the sisters and brothers, the sons and daughters, and the wives left alone to raise their children.\"\\nBut she lost patience with the focus of Republican senators on talking points used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice on the next Sunday\\'s talk shows that focused on a protest at the U.S. post in Benghazi, which turned out not to have taken place.\\nOpinion: Rand Paul vs. Hillary Clinton, clash of titans\\nWhen Sen. Ron Johnson pressed Clinton on why the State Department didn\\'t call U.S. personnel who were evacuated from Benghazi to determine whether there was a protest, Clinton took him to task.\\n\"With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans,\" Clinton reminded Johnson as she banged her hand on the table.\\n\"Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they\\'d go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening,\" she said.\\nPhotos: Hillary Clinton through the years\\n4\\\\. Militants in Mali and Algeria have arms from Libya\\nClinton warned the security situation in northern Mali, where international forces are battling militants, has been exacerbated by flow of weapons from neighboring Libya following the fall of Moammar Gadhafi.\\nShe said there was \"no doubt\" such weapons were also used in an attack by militants on an Algerian natural gas plant last week.\\nShe noted the aftermath of the Arab spring has changed power dynamics and stretched security forces across the region thin.\\nCalling the campaign struggle against the Islamic fighters a necessary response to \"a very serious, ongoing threat,\" Clinton said the \"United States cannot permit northern Mali to become a safe-haven for Islamist rebels that could eventually pose a more direct threat to U.S. interests.\"\\nNoting the increased strength of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the regional affiliate of the al Qaeda network fighting along side local Malians, Clinton warned that the United States must prepare for the possibility that groups like AQIM could threaten direct attacks on U.S. interests as they gain power.\\n\"You can\\'t say because they haven\\'t done something they\\'re not going to do it,\" Clinton said. \"This is not only a terrorist syndicate, it is a criminal enterprise.

Republicans still aren\\'t buying it\\nWhile their tone was generally respectful, several Republican senators made clear they were unsatisfied with Clinton\\'s answers.\\nSen. John McCain, R-Arizona, one of the administration\\'s toughest critics since the Benghazi attack, took Clinton to task for what he considered lackluster attention to the growing threat in Benghazi.\\nMcCain wanted to know why Clinton hadn\\'t read a cable from Ambassador Christopher Stevens warning that the mission in Benghazi could not survive a sustained assault.\\nSen. Rand Paul said it would have been an offense worthy of firing Clinton had he been president.\\nMcCain also blasted Clinton\\'s answers to questions about the administration\\'s claim that a protest had taken place in Benghazi.\\n\"The American people deserve to know answers, and they certainly don\\'t deserve false answers,\" McCain told Clinton.\\nClinton was more diplomatic with her old friend, saying she respected his strong feelings for the incident given his own relationship with Stevens, but that they disagreed about what happened and when it happened with respect to explaining events.\\nIn addition to lessons the State Department learned about improving security at diplomatic posts, Clinton, who called the Benghazi attack an act of terrorism since Day One, suggested the administration might learn another lesson.\\n\"Just withhold.

      "features:b'(CNN)The shootings\\' main similarity is that the officer was white and the victim was black and unarmed. Outside of that, the highly publicized police shootings in Ferguson and North Charleston bear only mild resemblance.\\nSo what\\'s changed between the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in August, and that of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, last weekend? And did the backlash and publicity of the Ferguson shooting influence the handling of the North Charleston incident?\\nIt\\'s tough to say for sure, but here are some of the stark differences in the cases, the lessons learned by both police and the public, and concrete changes that could help mend tensions in the future.\\nJustification for shooting\\nFerguson: Officer Darren Wilson said he shot Brown after the two struggled over Wilson\\'s gun, and witnesses to the shooting had different accounts -- often conflicting -- of where Wilson was, where Brown was and whether Brown was surrendering or charging the officer.\\nNorth Charleston: Though it\\'s unclear what happened in the moments before a bystander began recording the incident on his phone, it\\'s 100% clear from the video that Scott was not posing a threat to Officer Michael Slager when the policeman opened fire on Scott as he ran away.\\nTakeaway: Where Brown\\'s killing was a breeding ground for speculation -- with a stark divide between those who said Wilson was justified and those who said Brown was senselessly slain -- no such debate has emerged in the Scott shooting.\\nIt would be tough to extrapolate for certain, but it\\'s possible that the clear-cut imagery of an officer shooting a fleeing man in the back resulted in the prompt charges against the officer, and that quick reaction by authorities in South Carolina after the video surfaced headed off the sort of violence that repeatedly unfolded in Ferguson as the process of determining Wilson\\'s fate dragged on for months.\\nRace\\nFerguson: Black residents outnumber whites in the St. Louis suburb by more than a 2-to-1 ratio, yet at the time of Brown\\'s shooting, there were only three black officers on the city\\'s 53-member force, and there was only one African-American member of the six-member City Council. (Two more African-Americans were voted in during this week\\'s city\\'s elections.)\\nNorth Charleston: It\\'s closer to an even split here, with census data from 2010 showing the city is 47% black and 42% white. The makeup of the city\\'s police department is unclear, though it\\'s been widely reported that 2007 federal figures indicated it was about 80% black. Three of the 10 City Council members are black.\\nTakeaway: The ratio of white and black officers on the North Charleston Police Department appears to more closely mirror the makeup of its population than does the Ferguson Police Department, but both are considerably off. As for the city councils, the latest election in Ferguson makes its governing body more representative than North Charleston\\'s.\\nBut before you place too much emphasis on the percentages, there are other variables to consider, like policing methods, as CNN political commentator Marc Lamont Hill pointed out. Changing the racial makeup of a department alone won\\'t do the trick if officers aren\\'t taught the best practices.\\n\"Black people didn\\'t march and fight and struggle to have black officers kill us and black officers beat us and black officers harass us,\" he said. \"I want police officers who are capable of doing the job properly. We need community-based policing if we\\'re going to believe that police are the proper force to be in our neighborhoods.\"\\nVideo footage\\nFerguson: There was no bystander video of Michael Brown\\'s death -- no concrete evidence to support or refute different witness claims about what had transpired.\\nNorth Charleston: It\\'s unlikely Slager would have been fired and charged with murder so quickly if not for video shot by witness Feidin Santana. Even North Charleston\\'s police chief said he was disgusted by the footage of Scott\\'s shooting.\\nNot only does the video show Slager firing eight shots at Scott as he\\'s running away, it also shows him placing a dark-colored object next to Scott\\'s lifeless body.\\nThat could be significant, because Slager initially said Scott had taken his Taser and he feared for his life. But if investigators determine the object dropped next to Scott\\'s body was actually the Taser, Slager could be accused of planting evidence.\\nThe takeaway: Ferguson resident Alexis Templeton said what happened in her city helped people across the country to feel empowered to stand up for themselves. The video of the North Charleston shooting, she said, is vital.\\n\"If there is no video, folks don\\'t believe it because it sounds so asinine that something like this would ever happen in this country,\" she said. \"But with a video, you can\\'t say it\\'s not happening.\"\\nViolence to peace\\nFerguson: The largely peaceful protests in Ferguson were marred by looting, arson and even shootings. Violence erupted again in November after Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, wasn\\'t indicted. And even after Ferguson\\'s police chief resigned last month, two officers were shot during a protest at the Ferguson Police Department.\\nNorth Charleston: After Scott was killed in South Carolina over the weekend, protests in North Charleston have been peaceful so far.\\nThe takeaway: Some Ferguson residents say what happened in their city is playing a role in the way North Charleston is handling its own tragedy. Lee Smith, who recently made an unsuccessful bid for a Ferguson City Council seat, said he was glad to see authorities in South Carolina charge Slager with murder.\\n\"I am hopeful that their motives are right and not just based on the fact that they are trying to avoid the same types of issues that came down in Ferguson,\" Smith said.\\nCities\\' responses\\nFerguson: It took Ferguson police six days to publicly identify Wilson as the officer who shot Brown, and in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, then-police chief Thomas Jackson decided not to visit Brown\\'s family. And rather than charge Wilson and let a grand jury decide whether the charges had merit -- as many civil rights advocates wanted -- the prosecutor in the case instead made the unorthodox choice of presenting both sides himself and letting the grand jury decide whether to charge the officer.\\nNorth Charleston: Slager was identified by authorities and charged with murder on Tuesday, two days after Santana shared his video with Scott\\'s family. Mayor Keith Summey denounced the shooting and said Slager made a \"bad decision.\" Both Summey and the police chief also visited Scott\\'s family.\\n\"When you\\'re wrong, you\\'re wrong,\" he said. \"And if you make a bad decision -- don\\'t care if you\\'re behind the shield or just a citizen on the street -- you have to live by that decision.\"\\nThe takeaway: Former Ferguson Mayor Brian Fletcher said the city has influenced others.\\n\"I think these situations are given much more scrutiny now,\" said Fletcher, who won a seat on Ferguson\\'s city council this week. \"They have seen what has happened here in Ferguson. Every mayor and city council is very cautious in what they say and what they do.\"\\nBody cameras\\nFerguson: After Brown\\'s death in August, many asked why Wilson didn\\'t have a body camera. The shooting spurred a nationwide debate over whether officers should wear cameras on their lapels. Three months later, President Barack Obama pledged $263 million to procure body cameras and training for up to 50,000 police officers.\\nNorth Charleston: Slager also was not wearing a body camera when he killed Scott. But after the shooting, the mayor said the city was ordering an additional 150 body cameras \"so every officer on the street\" in the city will have one. That\\'s in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered, Summey said.\\nThe takeaway: Not everyone agrees that all officers should wear body cameras. Some police unions have scoffed at the idea, and the American Civil Liberties Union has cited privacy concerns. They\\'re also expensive. Several camera models cost at least $500 each, and storing all that footage can cost as much as $20,000 a year.\\nBut National Urban League President Marc Morial said more body cameras will help protect not just the public, but also police.\\n\"I think if officers know that their actions are being recorded on a consistent basis, it\\'s going to protect good officers who do the right thing,\" Morial said. \"But it\\'s also going to ferret out, if you will, bad actions by bad officers.\"\\nCNN\\'s Moni Basu, Gregory Wallace and Wolf Blitzer contributed to the report.' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid announced Friday he will not seek reelection next year, a decision that will reshape the hierarchy of the Senate Democratic Caucus and upend Nevada\\xe2\\x80\\x99s political landscape.\\nIn a farewell  video, Reid, 75, said his brutal eye injury in January that nearly left him blind in one eye gave him time to reevaluate his life and career. His departure will deprive the Senate of one of its fiercest infighters, who played a lead role in shepherding President Barack Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s health care law through the chamber and regularly stymied Republicans.\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had time to ponder and to think. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to be more concerned about the country, the Senate, the state of Nevada than us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Reid said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd as a result of that, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to run for reelection.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nA person close to Reid said he made the decision before his January exercise injury that broke bones around his eye and ribs and led to multiple surgeries. Reid wanted to sit with the decision for a while and see how he felt about it. While on the mend at his Washington condo during the first part of the legislative session, Reid did not change his mind but kept his decision secret, even vowing publicly to run for reelection.\\nHe plans to remain Democratic leader until the end of next year when the current Congress adjourns. He informed President Barack Obama of his decision Thursday night, a source said.\\nThe announcement caps a career in Washington spanning more than three decades, starting in 1983 in the House. After winning a Senate seat in 1986, Reid tended heavily to home-state matters: a planned nuclear waste dump in Southern Nevada, and mining and grazing policies that affected the vast rural northern part of his state, much of it under federal control and where Reid was widely disliked.\\nFirst and foremost, Reid was a relentless critic of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository about 100 miles outside of Las Vegas, repeatedly gumming up the Senate to slow progress on the multi-billion dollar project, which was ultimately scrapped.\\nReid, a soft-spoken, uninspiring public speaker but savvy backroom political operator, plotted his way up the rungs of Democratic leadership. In 2005 he became Senate Democratic leader, and two years later majority leader.\\nAs leader, Reid developed a no-nonsense, hard-ball style that came to define his stewardship. He muscled through Senate passage of the Affordable Care Act on Christmas Eve in 2009 on a straight party-line vote, when his party controlled 60 seats, enough to overcome a GOP filibuster. In 2013, Reid took the unprecedented step of invoking the so-called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnuclear option,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a move that gutted filibuster rules for presidential nominations that critics said altered the deliberative nature of the body.\\nAnd as a senator, Reid\\xe2\\x80\\x99s politics grew more liberal, moving to the left on issues like gun control, abortion rights and immigration.\\nBut after losing the Senate majority last year, a number of Democrats blamed his tight grip on the amendment process, and the lack of Senate votes, for being a liability in the midterm elections that led to the loss of nine Democratic seats. For the first time in his career, Reid faced open dissension among senators about returning to the Democratic leadership post. As he ran for minority leader unopposed, Reid lost at least six votes from his colleagues, a sign that he was for the first time vulnerable in the top post.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want to be able to go out at the top of my game,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Reid told The New York Times.\\nWith his departure now imminent, Democrats who have been waiting for a chance to succeed Reid will have the opportunity to run for leader. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, who currently is the chief messenger for the caucus and serves as the No. 3, is viewed within the chamber as the clear frontrunner. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unclear yet if others may run, but Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, endorsed Schumer for the job Friday.\\nSuch a race, however, typically occurs after an election, behind closed doors, and is conducted via a secret ballot, meaning there are an array of possibilities that could take place.\\nMoreover, his decision throws into flux the Nevada Senate race, which was already expected to be one of the most heavily contested in the country. Reid had been insisting he would run for reelection, interviewing staff and fundraising for a campaign. He even told his staff at a private meeting in the Senate Mansfield Room in February that he was running for reelection.\\nWith poor approval ratings back home, Reid faced an all-out battle to survive, similar to the improbable victory he pulled off in 2010 against tea party favorite Sharron Angle.\\nNow Democrats will look closely at Catherine Cortez Masto, a former Nevada attorney general. While the Republicans hope that the popular Nevada governor, Brian Sandoval, will run, he has long been viewed as very unlikely to do so. The Nevada Senate GOP leader, Michael Roberson, has been seen as a potential candidate for the seat.\\nBorn in the dusty mining town of Searchlight, Nev., and raised in a tiny house with no running water, Reid grew to be a fixture in Las Vegas and Nevada politics for years before becoming one of Washington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most powerful figures. After first being elected as his state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lieutenant governor at age 30 in 1970, he was defeated in his first try at the Senate four years later.\\nHe then lost a bid for mayor but found his footing atop the Nevada Gaming Commission, where he battled organized crime and his wife even found a bomb in the family car. Before his career in politics, Reid was an amateur boxer and served as a Capitol Police Officer in Washington.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomeone with my background, my upbringing, to have the experiences I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had is really a miracle,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Reid said in the video. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I want you to know that I am so grateful for your invaluable help. I have done my best. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been perfect, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve really tried my hardest to represent the people of the state of Nevada.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBurgess Everett contributed to this report.' target:-1\n",

Jay Nixon ordered National Guard troops to the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson early Monday after authorities used tear gas to clear the streets of protesters hours before a midnight curfew took effect for a second consecutive day, while a private autopsy on the unarmed black teen who was fatally shot by a white police officer reportedly showed six gunshot wounds, including two in the head.\\n\"Tonight, a day of hope, prayers, and peaceful protests was marred by the violent criminal acts of an organized and growing number of individuals, many from outside the community and state, whose actions are putting the residents and businesses of Ferguson at risk,\" Nixon said in a statement released by his office. \"I am directing the highly capable men and women of the Missouri National Guard to assist ... in restoring peace and order to this community.\"\\nAs night fell in Ferguson, another peaceful protest quickly deteriorated after marchers pushed toward one end of a street and authorities \\xe2\\x80\\x94 who said they were responding to reports of gunfire, looting, vandalism and protesters who hurled Molotov cocktails \\xe2\\x80\\x94 pushed them back by repeatedly firing tear gas.

      "features:b'In April, there was only a 91 percent chance that Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) would run for president of the United States. Now, he\\'s 100 percent ready.\\nOn Monday morning, the longtime hopeful officially announced his 2016 presidential run in his hometown of Central, South Carolina, in front of his family\\'s restaurant and pool hall.\\n\"I\\'m Lindsey Graham and I\\'m running for president of the United States,\" he said during the campaign launch -- and, as he added later in the announcement, he is \"ready to be commander in chief on day one.\"\\nGraham, who has never sent an email, is a small-town boy from a blue-collar family. A first-generation college student, Graham attended the University of South Carolina for both undergrad and law school -- a time that shaped Graham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desire to restructure Social Security, according to The New York Times, since he and his teenage sister were financially dependent on their deceased parents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 benefits.\\nAfter graduating from law school, Graham was on active duty as an attorney for almost seven years in the U.S. Air Force, including four years in Germany. From 1989 to 1995, he served in the South Carolina Air National Guard before joining the U.S. Air Force Reserves.\\n\"The Air Force has been one of the best things that has ever happened to me,\" Graham said in a statement announcing his retirement from the armed forces last week -- adding that he was leaving the service only because he had reached the mandatory retirement age of 60. \"It identified and developed my talent, and helped me become useful to my country. It offered me adventure and showed me the world. It gave me a purpose bigger than myself. It put me in the company of patriots. It\\'s been almost like family to me.\"\\nSouth Carolina\\xe2\\x80\\x99s senior senator has been critical of President Barack Obama\\'s foreign policy, attacking him for being more involved with Ebola than combating the Islamic State group. Graham also warned about possible terrorist attacks from Syria and Iraq. Graham has said he wouldn\\'t have a problem ordering airstrikes against Americans looking to join terrorist groups abroad.\\n\"Simply put, radical Islam is running wild -- they are large, they are rich, they\\'re entrenched. As president I will make them small, poor and on the run,\" Graham said during his launch.\\n\"The terrorists are selling a glorious death. We must sell a hopeful life,\" he added.\\nThe original author of the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, Graham has built a strong pro-life rapport during his time in the Senate and, in 2006, was deemed Legislator of the Year by South Carolina Citizens for Life.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople who are social conservative, hold your head up high. Be proud of speaking for the unborn, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a pro-life guy with exceptions of rape and incest,\" Graham told Boston Herald Radio earlier this month. \"When a woman is raped, it is not the will of God, it is a crime, and the perpetrator should be punished accordingly. The woman will make that decision about what to do after being the victim of a crime,\" he said.\\nGraham personally opposes same-sex marriage, though he said last month he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think a constitutional ban against gay marriage is feasible. If the Supreme Court rules against same-sex marriage bans this year, the Republican Party needs to drop the issue, he said.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see how you get a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman ratified by 3/4 of the states given the way the lay of the land is today. So the court\\'s gonna hear the case,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told Boston Herald Radio.\\nIn 2008, Graham declared support for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex couples from the altar as a means to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdefend and promote traditional South Carolina values.\" He also compared the fight for LGBT equality to the abolition of slavery and to allowing polygamists to marry.\\nGraham promised Republicans that he would \"be a voice for social conservative values without apology or animosity\" during the announcement. He also reached across the aisle to ensure Democrats that they were Graham\\'s \"fellow countrymen\" and he \"will seek the common political ground our nation so desperately needs to find.\"\\n\"I intend to be president not of a single party, but of a nation,\" he said.\\nThough he joked in October that \"white men who are in male-only clubs are going to do great in my presidency,\" Graham has occasionally broken with the GOP while serving in the Senate. Graham has called out the Republican stance -- or lack thereof \\\\-- on climate change, publicly supported confirming Loretta Lynch as U.S. attorney general and even asked Republicans to end the congressional standoff with Obama over immigration policy and funding for the Department of Homeland Security.\\nThe senator supports creating a pathway to full citizenship for undocumented immigrants living in the U.S., though he also fully supports increasing already-high border patrol; denying federal public benefits for immigrants while they are going through the naturalization process and denying amnesty for those already living in the U.S.\\nGraham\\'s support for campaign finance reform puts him at odds with the majority of Republicans in Congress. He supported a 2002 law that tightened campaign finance limits and denounced Citizens United, the Supreme Court decision that allowed unlimited political spending by corporations. He has predicted that concern surrounding the influence of super PACs will grow, and said that a determining factor in his decision to run in 2016 is his belief that he could fundraise enough to pay for his campaign.\\nBut in 2014, West Main Street Values PAC raised around $900,000 for Graham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Senate re-election campaign, according to USA Today, along with subsidizing $272,000 worth of advertising -- a gift that helped Graham beat out six other challengers in the primary.\\nGraham ended his announcement on a slightly gaudy note.\\n\"I know the players,\" he said. \"I know our friends and enemies alike ... but, most importantly, they know me.\"' target:-1\n",

Being a practical 16-year-old, I bought my mom a carton of cigarettes. (No minor tobacco-purchase laws had been enacted in my state yet.)\\nYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to point out how stupid this Mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Day gift was. My sister did. She said:\\nSmoking kills. We want our mother to STOP smoking. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re only hastening her death. Your gift is thoughtless, lazy, tasteless.\\nI was sufficiently shamed.\\nBut it was too late.\\nIt was Mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Day morning, so I presented mom the carton of smokes. I took a deep breath and plowed through my reasoning. Yes, I had reasons. It went something like this:\\nI noticed as I bought my own gum and Dr. Pepper with my hard-earned $3.35 minimum wage cash, that a carton of cigarettes was expensive. Outrageously expensive!\\nAnd then light bulb moment.\\nWhy don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I save you the trouble of having to buy pack after pack, and you can save your money and buy something you REALLY want with the money you save now that you have an entire carton of cigarettes? Exhale.\\nMy mom, not exactly known for her sweet disposition, looked at me and then the carton of Tareyton smokes she held then back at me. Much to my smug sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disappointment she said:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right. They are expensive. Thank you for the gift, Sonja.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nI got to thinking how I've turned over this memory several times when my mother was alive and since her death (not from smoking.) And I wondered on this Mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Day: What will my three daughters, ages 10-13, remember about me after I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m gone?\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s such a bizarre story to remember, but I remember it clearly. My mother's puzzled face, the way the veins stood out in her hands as she clutched the carton and my own deep relief and gratitude.\\nMy girls and I make dozens of memories every day. What will they remember?\\nWill my 11-year-old daughter remember how last night she asked for help on her report on Afghanistan and I told her firmly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important that you do your own work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAnd it is important. But really, I was just too tired to help.\\nMy daughter saw right through that B.S. answer. Will she remember that?\\nOr will she remember how this morning, I was late to work because I stopped everything to overturn laundry baskets, to move couch cushions and pull open every drawer in the house to find a needed costume piece for a play she was doing?\\nHonestly, probably neither.\\nWe as parents have no control over what memories our children will carry forward with them through life and after we're gone from this Earth.\\nBut whether we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re conscious of it or not, we are trying to forge some lasting impression. Will they remember us as fair or fierce? Ambitious or compassionate? As kind or kick-ass?\\nWhy I think that memory stuck\\nI think the reason the memory of the worst Mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Day gift ever has stayed with me is because my mother SAW me in that moment. She saw past the absurdity of a gift purchased at a gas station, and saw me.\\nA proud teenager presenting her mother with a practical gift bought through hard work by manning the fryer at Burger King that I hoped would save her oodles of money so she could buy something nice for herself.\\nOur good. Our ugly. They will forget much of it. Remember some of it.\\nWe can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t control what they will remember.\\nBut maybe there is one way we can influence a tiny sliver of the memories our children will carry about us parents. It comes at those hold-your-breath moments when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking at us, looking at them.\\nFor example, when you buy your mom a carton of cigarettes on Mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Day and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve locked eyes.\\nWe parents hold a lot of power in those moments. How we react is everything. Our children care what we think. About them. About their choices. (Especially the dumb ones.) And when they are in the moment waiting and watching us, it matters how we react because we could just be creating a forever memory.\\nWhen I think back to that Mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Day, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a little bit embarrassed about my choice of gift, but when I think about my mother, I get a warm, all-over feeling.\\nI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how she would react to my gift. She could have destroyed me with her response and maybe I would have remembered that to this day or maybe not.\\nBut she paused for two beats \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I'm guessing because her first unspoken reaction wasn't all that loving \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and took the gift in the spirit it was meant.\\nBecause of this, my lasting impression of her is someone who's cool, wise and compassionate.\\nAs for my sister, I remember her as kind of snotty.\\nFollow us on Facebook.\\nREAD MORE:\" target:0\n",
      "features:b'It has become a tradition in American politics to greet each party\\'s reversals of fortunes by proclaiming that it has been smashed beyond any short-term repair, perhaps even reduced to \"permanent minority\" status. This week we\\'ve seen just how quickly the conventional wisdom can see-saw: After a year of editorials about the decimated state of the GOP, suddenly we\\'ve started seeing takes like this:\\nPolitico\\nAnd this:\\nVox\\nAnd you can see why! The Republicans now control Congress, the White House, and a majority of state governments, and they are about to appoint a justice to the Supreme Court. The Democrats\\' political operation has turned out to be as hollow as a triple-A rating from Moody\\'s in 2006. As the old clich\\xc3\\xa9 goes, the Dems are in disarray.\\nThomas NastBut so are the Republicans. Donald Trump won the GOP nomination because the party had slipped from its gatekeepers\\' grasp, and he broke with normal political behavior by continuing to blast away at his Republican rivals even after accepting the nomination. It wouldn\\'t be true to say that he owes nothing to the party establishment\\xe2\\x80\\x94the RNC certainly gave him crucial on-the-ground assistance at the end of the campaign\\xe2\\x80\\x94but he won the election on his own terms and clearly doesn\\'t feel obliged to pay obeisance to anyone. He could conceivably decide to focus on the issues that interest him and let the usual Republican suspects set the agenda for everything else; he could just as conceivably treat Paul Ryan (or Ryan\\'s successor) as the head of another opposition party.\\nAnd Trump himself is vulnerable to the same sort of storm that propelled him into office. You younger readers may not know this, but in the long-ago days of 2015 Ted Cruz was seen as a bomb-throwing radical challenging the centers of Republican power. Now the GOP grassroots write him off as a Goldman Sachs puppet who tried to derail the Trump Train. If Cruz and other onetime Tea Party insurgents are already being decried as an old order to be blown aside, Trump may someday find himself in the crosshairs too. Live by the uprising, die by the uprising.\\nSo the Republicans clearly have the upper hand in government, but the Republican Party remains weak, in the sense of not having an orderly, hierarchical structure that can keep everyone in line. The Democratic Party looks pretty weak too\\xe2\\x80\\x94and now that Trump has shown how much of a paper tiger a party\\'s gatekeepers can be, it\\'s entirely possible that a Trump figure will soon arise on the Dems\\' side of the aisle as well.\\nThese aren\\'t predictions, mind you. Trump could face an insurgency, or he could remake the party in his image. The Democrats could find themselves nominating Bernie Sanders or Kanye West or a sentient Facebook meme, or they could clear the way for yet another grey old pol from the club. The point is how fragile those edifices of party power are, and how much uncertainty that entails. (And how much pure contingency too. If this election had been held a month earlier, maybe Hillary Clinton would be president-elect and the Republicans would be getting bombarded with these your-party-is-a-goner analyses.)\\nYouTubePerhaps this is the kind of unstable situation that just isn\\'t tenable, and the two-party system will eventually break down. You can certainly see signs of dissatisfaction with it: record numbers of people identifying as independents, the strongest third-party results in 20 years, the very fact that a former independent with no institutional loyalty to the GOP can sweep in to take the Republican nomination and then the presidency. If more jurisdictions follow Maine\\'s lead and adopt more pluralistic voting systems, we might finally get a party system that doesn\\'t try to squeeze everybody into just two categories.\\nOr maybe not. Maine\\'s new ranked-voting system looks attractive, but Maine is just one state. The rest of us still have a first-past-the-post system that seems to gravitate naturally toward a two-party setup whether or not those parties are institutionally strong. There\\'s a lot of churning in the history of American politics. The parties might just keep remaking themselves, incrementally or not, in a perpetual process of reinvention that only feels like constant collapse.' target:1\n",
      "features:b'A week after one of the most unruly debates in modern political history, the four remaining contenders for the Republican presidential nomination engaged in a polite parsing of their differences Thursday night over radical Islam, Social Security and other weighty matters.\\nThere was no discussion of genitals, no schoolyard taunts, no candidates screaming to be heard over the shouting of others.\\nThe two hours on a stage at the University of Miami in Coral Gables was one of the lowest-key sessions since the early, friendlier days of the GOP contest last summer.\\n\"I cannot believe how civil it\\'s been up here,\" Donald Trump, the front-runner for the nomination and chief instigator in previous debate-night brawls, marveled half an hour into the staid affair.\\nHeld five days before a crucial round of primaries in Florida, Ohio and other big states, the debate \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the 12th of the Republican contest \\xe2\\x80\\x94 seemed unlikely to alter the direction of the race in any meaningful way.\\nEven though the bluster was gone and Trump remained subdued, the Manhattan businessman lost none of his swagger.\\nHe suggested a willingness to send up to 30,000 U.S. ground troops to the Middle East to fight Islamic State militants, a dramatic escalation of the country\\'s military involvement.\\n\"We don\\'t fight like we used to fight,\" Trump said, a line he applied as well to trade negotiations and other facets of the country\\'s policies. \"We need to fight to win.\"\\nHe reiterated his support for waterboarding and other outlawed \"enhanced interrogation\" techniques to fight terrorists, and would rewrite the law to do so. \"Or we\\'re being a bunch of suckers, and they are laughing at us,\" Trump said.\\nAsked about his comment a day earlier that \"Islam hates us,\" Trump repeated the assertion and suggested that anyone who felt differently was callow and a slave to \"political correctness.\"\\nCiting the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, he said: \"There\\'s tremendous hatred, and I\\'ll stick with what I said.\"\\n\"I\\'m not interested in being politically correct,\" Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida responded evenly. \"I\\'m interested in being correct.\"\\nHe said it was wrong to stereotype an entire faith and also counterproductive to alienate countries with large Muslim populations that are vital U.S. allies.\\n\"We\\'re going to have to work with other Muslims \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 to defeat ISIS,\" Rubio said, using a popular acronym for Islamic State.\\nSen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Gov. John Kasich agreed. \"We need a president who understands the national security interests of this country,\" Cruz said, implying that Trump did not.\\nBut the exchange struck none of the sparks seen in earlier debates, an obviously conscious decision by Trump, Cruz and Rubio, who had clashed harshly and repeatedly on the debate stage just seven days earlier.\\nEven when prodded by the moderators, they declined to engage as they had before.\\nTypical was the disagreement over Social Security.\\nTrump has broken with many conservatives by insisting there is no need to cut back on benefits for future retirees to preserve the program. \"I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is,\" Trump said.\\nRubio warned that the program would go bankrupt without cuts, saying he would allow the retirement age to eventually rise to 70. He said Trump\\'s proposal to cut \"waste, fraud and abuse\" would fall well short of the changes needed to place the program on a permanently sound financial footing.\\nCruz took it a step further, asserting that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, also talks of cutting \"waste, fraud, and abuse.\"\\n\"The answer can\\'t just be \\xe2\\x80\\x94 wave a magic wand and say, \\'Problem go away,\\'\" he added. \"You have to understand the problems.\"\\nWhen CNN co-moderator Dana Bash asked whether he was comparing Trump to Clinton \\xe2\\x80\\x94 an obvious invitation to attack \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Cruz said Trump would have to speak for himself.\\nThroughout the night the candidates agreed more often than they disagreed. On immigration, both Cruz and Kasich spoke of building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump\\'s signature promise.\\nKasich, though, took a softer tone, praising immigration\\'s role in the country and insisting that many of the millions of people here illegally would have an opportunity to stay \\xe2\\x80\\x94 though not obtain citizenship \\xe2\\x80\\x94 under his administration.\\nTrump was the focus for much of the debate. At one point, he was pressed to explain the outbreaks of violence at several of his rallies, including the assault of a North Carolina protester that was caught Wednesday on videotape. He said people \"come with tremendous passion and love for the country\" but also anger over all they see going wrong.\\n\"But I certainly do not condone that,\" he said of the attacks.\\nTrump has been known to depart from GOP orthodoxy on a host of issues, but on Thursday, he said he did not see himself as fundamentally remaking the Republican Party. He said he believed his views were \"very similar\" to many in the party, but acknowledged an exception.\\n\"I am different in one primary respect, and that\\'s trade,\" Trump said. \"I feel that we have had horrible negotiators, horrible trade deals. The jobs in this country are disappearing, and especially the good jobs.\"\\nHis protectionist rhetoric marks a departure from the free-trade advocacy of many in the Republican Party, particularly business interests.\\nWith his new above-the-fray stance, Trump at times acted as though the nominating fight was already over.\\nHe noted that former rival Ben Carson planned to endorse him Friday, and used his opening statement to call for party unity \\xe2\\x80\\x94 presumably around his candidacy.\\nThe debate could be the last for Rubio and Kasich, both facing must-win contests in their home states Tuesday.\\nEven if they win \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and Rubio is a significant underdog \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it would be difficult to overtake Trump in the delegate count after his victories in 15 of the first 24 contests. Five states in all \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Illinois and North Carolina \\xe2\\x80\\x94 will hold primaries on Tuesday.\\nDespite the high stakes, Rubio has said in recent days that he regretted the nasty and personal tone of last week\\'s debate, at which he called Trump University \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a now-defunct series of get-rich real estate seminars that is the subject of numerous lawsuits \\xe2\\x80\\x94 one of several Trump-brand businesses that have ripped off consumers. He charged that the novice candidate lacked a serious grasp of or interest in foreign policy.\\nTrump shot back with full force, calling Rubio a lightweight and \"little Marco.\" He derided Cruz as \"lyin\\' Ted.\"\\nIn his opening statement Thursday night, Cruz suggested he\\'d had enough.

His excesses defined him: the scorching rants, the seductive oversharing, the caustic insults and endless public feuds.\\nHarmless theatrics, he said.\\nBut the in-your-face instincts and boundary-breaking behavior that Mr. Christie brought to public life found a vindictive host in the fiercely loyal circle around him, as the federal indictment of a top appointee and a former deputy chief of staff in the George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal laid bare on Friday.\\nThe 37-page charging document recounts a ruthless act of political retribution: To punish a small-town mayor for refusing to endorse Mr. Christie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2013 re-election, the governor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s confidants unleashed a major traffic jam that gridlocked ordinary commuters, emergency responders and children on the first day of school.\\nNowhere does the indictment say Mr. Christie, a Republican, knew of the scheme or was involved in it.\\nYet it was a crime of political vengeance, the indictment makes clear, that was conceived in furtherance of Mr. Christie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s political ambitions, and carried out in his name.\\nNow, the growing risk for Mr. Christie is that the very belligerence that electrified voters, the press and the Republican Party, and catapulted him into a credible contender for the White House, may wind up putting the presidency out of his reach.\\nBrigid Harrison, a professor of political science at Montclair State University who has studied Mr. Christie closely for years, said the indictments of Bridget Anne Kelly and Bill Baroni, once two of the governor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most loyal and trusted lieutenants, spelled the death knell for his national aspirations.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEven if he is not directly connected to the indictments,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Professor Harrison said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9che is guilty of creating a political culture in which corruption was allowed to flourish.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMr. Christie faces the specter of a lengthy and embarrassing criminal trial overshadowing the 2016 presidential campaign, in which the star witness \\xe2\\x80\\x94 David Wildstein, a onetime Christie loyalist who pleaded guilty on Friday to two counts of conspiracy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 still maintains the governor was aware of the lane-closing plot as it happened.\\nEven so, Mr. Christie treated the outcome of the federal investigation as a personal exoneration.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cToday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charges make clear that what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve said from day one is true,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the governor posted on Twitter. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had no knowledge or involvement in the planning or execution of this act.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut exoneration of the man is not exoneration of his leadership style.\\nMr. Christie and his staff have a history of punishing those who have crossed him. There was the state college professor whose budget was vetoed after he failed to sign off on a project that Mr. Christie favored.

His poll numbers are sagging badly. Voters openly taunt him at public events about the bridge episode. Donors fret about his viability. And longtime allies are defecting to rival campaigns.\\nTwo weeks ago, State Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos of New Jersey, a trusted Christie friend who served as chairman of his 2009 campaign for governor, declared his support for Jeb Bush.\\nIn candid moments, close allies of Mr. Christie acknowledge that his shot at winning the White House, which seemed so plausible a year ago, may have passed.\\nMr. Christie is fond of talking about the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ckill shot\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in politics: the fatal moment when a candidacy switches from viable to moribund. But over the past year, the governor has suffered a series of smaller, but still significant, wounds: He oversaw nine downgrades of New Jersey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credit rating; the repeated overestimation of state revenue projections; and the failure to make a $1.6 billion payment to New Jersey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deeply underfunded pension system.\\nA growing number of Republican operatives say that Mr. Christie has, in a sense, already bled out.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPolitically, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been dead for a year,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Rick Wilson, a longtime Republican political strategist, who is not aligned with any campaign for the 2016 race.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just the bridge,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Wilson continued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was that there were any number of better, more conservative, more electable candidates.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nNew Jersey, he added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cisn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the kind of economic success story that he could build a campaign around.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAs a parade of comparatively unblemished Republican rivals declare their candidacies, Mr. Christie has put off an announcement until late spring or early summer.\\nPresidential candidates have weathered messy campaign-season scandals. In 1992, Bill Clinton survived revelations of a longtime sexual affair with Gennifer Flowers, the existence of which he vigorously denied.\\nBut Americans are historically most forgiving of personal scandals involving deeply contrite officials. The problem for Mr. Christie is that the closing of access lanes to the George Washington Bridge stand as a unique case of public betrayal, an act mystifying in its meanness and unsettling in its indifference to the thousands of motorists involved.\\nFrom the start, Mr. Christie treated the closings as a nuisance, suggested the episode did not merit his attention and derided those who wondered whether his administration had played a role.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was the guy out there, in overalls and a hat,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he declared mockingly during a news conference in early December 2013. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI actually was the guy working the cones out there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWithin a few weeks, damning emails emerged showing that Ms. Kelly, his top political aide, had been deeply involved.\\nThose close to Mr. Christie vow that he will push ahead with a presidential campaign, regardless of his standing in the polls or his fund-raising totals.\\nHe is a practiced political gambler with a history of defying odds.\\nLittle was expected of him when President George W. Bush chose Mr. Christie, a little-known corporate lawyer and Republican fund-raiser, to take on the high-profile job of United States attorney for New Jersey in 2001. He turned it into a national platform for fighting public corruption. He faced daunting electoral math in 2009 when he challenged a wealthy, incumbent Democratic governor, Jon S. Corzine, in a reliably blue state. Mr. Christie prevailed, then won re-election by an overwhelming margin.\\nThese days, friends said, Mr. Christie is realistic about his chances in a crowded Republican nominating contest.

Senators who had even visited with McCain were circumspect in their remarks about their colleague. If anything was said, it was done in hushed tones and so far off the record. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because everyone on Capitol Hill - ranging from senators to aides to reporters and Senate staff - suspected they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d see a statement like this at some point from McCain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office. And as much as no one wanted to admit it, they knew it was just a matter of when.\\nThere was a point when some senators, perhaps wishfully, thought McCain may return to the Capitol and even vote. But that was never in the offing.\\nIn May, McCain published a statement announcing his opposition to the nomination of CIA Director Gina Haspel. A former prisoner of war, McCain often spoke about the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cenhanced interrogation techniques.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d After all, no one would say that McCain was subjected to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cenhanced interrogation techniques\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in Vietnam. McCain was tortured. McCain harbored reservations about Haspel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role at the CIA when it came to prisoners of war or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cenemy combatants.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believe Gina Haspel is a patriot who loves our country and has devoted her professional life to its service and defense,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d wrote McCain. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHowever, Ms. Haspel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role in overseeing the use of torture by Americans is disturbing. Her refusal to acknowledge torture\\xe2\\x80\\x99s immorality is disqualifying. I believe the Senate should exercise its duty of advice and consent and reject this nomination.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAt no point did McCain suggest he would vote on Haspel nor declare he would \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvote no.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The Arizona Republican simply stated what he thought his colleagues should do about Haspel.\\nA similar scenario played out in July when President Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court. Most senators put out boiler plate statements about \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmeeting the nominee\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or making up their mind after an in-person chat. McCain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hint at any of that.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI look forward to the Senate fulfilling this critical duty through a fair and thorough confirmation process,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said McCain.\\nWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also interesting is how much sway McCain continued to have on Capitol Hill in absentia. Reporters squawked when President Trump signed the defense bill and never mentioned McCain. Or, there were various occasions when the President appeared at a campaign rally and mocked the senator \\xe2\\x80\\x93 also not invoking McCain.\\nStill, McCain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s absence cast a long shadow through the Senate corridors. Senators listened to him this spring when he expressed concerns about Haspel.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHis opinion carries a lot of weight with a lot of people, me included,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., in May.\\nMcCain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s absence also amplified the narrow Senate Republican majority. With McCain, the GOP holds a tenuous 51-49 Senate advantage. The difference is but a single vote. This is why the Republican leadership sometimes sweated big votes. It magnified the votes of maverick Republicans who sometimes buck the party: Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Rand Paul, R-Ky.\\nNo event augmented the Republican\\xe2\\x80\\x99s narrow majority more than the abortive effort last summer to repeal and replace Obamacare. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., made a dramatic, Saturday nightdecision to postpone consideration of the keystone GOP issue once it became apparent McCain couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make it to the Senate to vote. McConnell would need McCain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vote to to approve a motion to launch the debate. In addition, McCain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vote was critical to passing the legislation.\\nMcCain returned to Washington some days later and voted to initiate debate on the Republican repeal and replace gambit. And then, finding the bill not to his liking, McCain torched the GOP efforts.\\nEven frank and reliable Republican sources are resistant to comment about what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s next. But Arizona law works like this: Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) would appoint another Republican until a special election is called in 2020. Arizona law requires the appointee \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbe of the same political party as the person vacating the office.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Arizona voters re-elected McCain to the Senate in 2016.

      "features:b'John Boehner has had enough.\\nThe embattled speaker, who fought off rumors of his political demise for years, announced Friday he would resign from Congress at the end of next month. The Ohio Republican, stunning his colleagues, said he didn\\'t want to put the House through a tumultuous vote on his speakership, and instead, he\\'ll leave Washington after 25 years and allow his party to pick a new successor in his absence.\\nStory Continued Below\\nConservatives had been circling with threats of a fresh coup attempt \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a showdown he felt he could win, but one he and his allies thought would do serious harm to the institution. But for all his grumbling over the down-and-out fights, the capitulations to rowdy right-wingers, and the \"spineless\" and \"squish\" insults, Boehner for five years had stuck it out, scoring a series of wins and maintaining his chain-smoking, merlot-swigging charm.\\nBoehner, who rose from bartender\\'s son to the most powerful man in Congress, was a classic mix of bravado and puddle of tears on Friday during a press conference announcing his decision to step aside at the end of October.\\n\"Last night I started thinking about this, and I woke up. I said my prayers as I always do, and I decided, you know, today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the day I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do this. As simple as that,\" Boehner said, veering from moist eyes to relief to whimsy, breaking into an impromptu rendition of \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\" from the Disney movie \"Song of the South.\"\\nBoehner, 65, planned to leave Congress at the end of 2014, but returned because of the unexpected electoral defeat of his second-in-command, Eric Cantor. The feeling was that another agonizing round of internal GOP turmoil over his future \"would do irreparable damage to the institution,\" a Boehner aide said.\\nAs he left the Capitol on Thursday evening, Boehner told two reporters \\xe2\\x80\\x94 one from POLITICO and another from The Washington Post \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that he had nothing left to accomplish after he brought Pope Francis to the Capitol. When asked whether he was resigning, Boehner laughed before exiting into a waiting SUV with his Capitol Police detail.\\nBoehner said that his No. 2, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy was so shocked when he broke the news to him Friday morning, that Boehner had to tell him \"about five times\" because he couldn\\'t believe it.\\nFirst elected to the House in 1990, Boehner came into power on the momentum of the 2010 tea party wave. But it was that movement that gave him constant problems. He clashed with the right over the debt limit, government funding, Obamacare and taxes. His tenure will also be remembered for his complicated relationship with President Barack Obama. He and Obama tried \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but repeatedly failed \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to reach a \"grand bargain\" on government spending.\\nBut Boehner has had some significant victories, including the landmark trade legislation that Congress passed earlier this year, as well as changes to entitlement programs.\\nNow that he doesn\\'t have internal political considerations to weigh, Boehner is certain to push through a government-funding bill next week that funds Planned Parenthood and keeps the government open.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have been doing this for 27 years, and this is the most selfless act that I have ever seen,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Rep. Lynn Westmoreland (R-Ga.), who is close with both Boehner and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), a former member of leadership who has clashed with Boehner, had similarly kind words.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the two years I served at the leadership table both my respect and affection grew for John Boehner,\" Hensarling said.\\nConservatives \\xe2\\x80\\x94 many of them members of the House Freedom Caucus \\xe2\\x80\\x94 said they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re already preparing for the vote to replace Boehner.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe has a long record of distinguished service but it\\'s time for new leadership,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cConservatives will be working together; it\\'s not going to be one or two of us, we\\'re going to make a deal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBoehner\\'s decision, relayed in a closed Republican meeting Friday morning, will indeed set off one of the most intense leadership scrambles in modern congressional GOP politics. Second in line is McCarthy, who is widely expected to serve as the next speaker. But there is serious unrest in the House Republican ranks.\\nA clutch of conservatives has continuously clashed with establishment Republicans. It takes 218 votes on the House floor to win the speakership, and many GOP insiders believe that McCarthy is the only person who could cobble together a coalition of that size.\\nShould McCarthy win, it will set off a fierce battle for majority leader. Boehner allies appear to be rallying around McCarthy for speaker already, providing him a hefty base for the internal House Republican Conference election, and a speaker vote on the House floor.\\nOne very formidable Republican is already taking himself out of the contest: Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is a good job for an empty nester,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ryan said.\\nThe posturing within GOP ranks has been underway for weeks. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana has been laying the groundwork for that battle, as has House Republican Conference Chairman Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington. Chief Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry of North Carolina will be favored for House Republican whip.\\nThere are wildcards, however. Rep.

Syria, as well as Iran, were at the top of the agenda in a meeting between the two leaders earlier in the day.\\nAsked about allegations that chemical weapons have been used in Syria, Obama stressed that \"we have to make sure that we know exactly what happened.\"\\nOnce the facts are established, Obama said, \"I have made clear that the use of chemical weapons is a game-changer.\"\\nHe said the use of those weapons would create an even more \"horrific scene\" in Syria -- and the \"international community has to act on that additional information.\"\\nAny confirmation that the Assad regime used the weapons would put pressure on the Obama administration to follow through on warnings that such an act would constitute crossing a \"red line.\" Syrian rebels and Assad&aposs regime on Tuesday accused each other of using those weapons, though Obama said he is \"deeply skeptical of any claim\" that the opposition was behind that kind of attack.\\nOfficials from the U.S. and Israel, though, were sending conflicting signals Wednesday about the potential evidence supporting such an attack.\\nShortly before Obama spoke, U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford said during testimony on Capitol Hill that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cso far we have no evidence to substantiate those reports.\"\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want to underline that we are looking very carefully,\" Ford said.\\nHis comments before the House Foreign Affairs Committee were made within hours of Yuval Steinitz, Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new minister of intelligence and strategic affairs, saying in an interview the weapons were used. However, he would not say how he reached the conclusion or which side used them.\\n\"It is apparently clear that chemical weapons were used,\" he said. \"The fact they apparently used chemical weapons against civilians needs to worry us and shows the urgency of taking care of the issue.\"\\nSteinitz said that after Iran&aposs nuclear program, the fate of Syria&aposs chemical weapons is the second most urgent issue that will be discussed with Obama during his 48-hour visit.\\nThere have been many reports and rumors of such weapons being used throughout the war but no attack has yet been confirmed. Israel has repeatedly expressed concern that Syria&aposs chemical arsenal could fall into the hands of anti-Israel militants like Lebanon&aposs Hezbollah, an Assad ally, or an Al Qaeda-linked group fighting with the rebels.\\nMore than 70,000 civilians have been killed in the attempt to overthrow Assad, and an estimated 1 billion others have fled to neighboring countries, including roughly 450,000 to Jordan.\\nFord also testified that the U.S. continues to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid. However, the administration maintains a policy of trying to negotiate a peace settlement and not providing weapons to opposition forces.\\nHe also declined to answer questions about what would be the consequence should U.S. officials find Syria crossed a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cred line\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by using chemical weapons.\\nObama has declared the use, deployment or transfer of the weapons would be a red line for possible U.S. military intervention.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am certain they have been discussed but I don&apost want to speculate,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ford said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don&apost want to go there.\"\\nThe Syrian state-run SANA news agency said Tuesday \"a missile containing a chemical substance\" was fired at the village by \"terrorists\" -- the term it uses for rebels.

Trump spent time with Pence and his family on Sunday and was due to meet Ernst in New Jersey on Monday.\\nErnst was endorsed by the Tea Party and won her Senate seat in 2014, running an infamous ad featuring a boast of growing up \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccastrating hogs on an Iowa farm\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the promise that once in Washington she would \\xe2\\x80\\x9cknow how to cut pork\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, thus making \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbig spenders \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 squeal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.

All three figures are expected to surge in coming days as more information is reported. Many homes and businesses were evacuated -- some just in the nick of time as flames approached.\\nVice President Mike Pence, who is visiting California, announced that President Trump approved a \"major disaster declaration\" for the state to assist in the response. Pence, who received a briefing on the wildfires, said 17 were burning in Northern California.\\n\"It\\'s heartbreaking to think that many of the fallen represent our most vulnerable, in some cases senior citizens who simply were not able to escape the flames that overcame their homes,\" Pence said. \"They\\'re in our prayers.\"\\nTaken as a group, the wildfires are already among the deadliest in California history.\\nCBS San Francisco reports the fires have consumed nearly 107,000 acres and turned whole neighborhoods into piles of ashes.\\nResidents who gathered at emergency shelters and grocery stores said they were shocked by the speed and ferocity of the flames. They recalled all the possessions they had left behind.\\n\"All that good stuff, I\\'m never going to see it again,\" said Jeff Okrepkie, who fled his neighborhood in Santa Rosa knowing it was probably the last time he would see his home of the past five years standing.\\nHis worst fears were confirmed Monday, when a friend sent him a photo of what was left: a smoldering heap of burnt metal and debris.\\nSome of the largest of the blazes burning over a 200-mile region were in Napa and Sonoma counties, home to dozens of wineries that attract tourists from around the world. They sent smoke as far south as San Francisco, about 60 miles away.\\nSonoma County said it has received more than 100 missing-person reports as family and friends scramble to locate loved ones.\\nThe reports have come via calls to a hotline the county set up for the missing, according to Scott Alonso, communications director for Sonoma County.\\nIt\\'s possible that many or most of the missing are safe but simply can\\'t be reached because of the widespread loss of cell service and other communications.\\nAs of Monday evening, 99,000 Pacific Gas & Electric customers were without power because of the wildfires in Northern California, a majority in Napa and Sonoma counties, PG&E officials told CBS San Francisco.\\nIn addition, PG&E crews had shut off gas service to about 26,000 customers as a precaution because flames can damage a gas pipe or meter, the station said.\\nWorkers in the renowned Northern California wine country picked through charred debris and struggled with what to do after wildfires swept through lush vineyards, destroying at least two wineries and damaging many others.\\nThe wind-driven wildfires came as Napa and Sonoma counties were finishing highly anticipated harvests of wine grapes. Monday normally would have found workers picking and processing the ripe grapes to make chardonnay and other wines.\\nInstead, melted and blackened wine bottles decorated the ruined Signorello Estate winery in Napa Valley. People at Paradise Ridge Winery in Sonoma County posted photos of debris and haze, saying they were \"heartbroken to share the news\" that the winery had burned.\\nMuch of the damage in Northern California was in Santa Rosa, a far larger and more developed city than usually finds itself at the mercy of a wildfire. The city is home to 175,000 residents, including both the wine-country wealthy and the working class.\\nThe flames were unforgiving to both groups. Hundreds of homes of all sizes were leveled by flames so hot they melted the glass off cars and turned aluminum wheels into liquid.\\nFormer San Francisco Giants pitcher Noah Lowry, who now runs an outdoor sporting goods store in Santa Rosa, was forced to flee in minutes along with his wife, two daughters and a son just over 2 weeks old.\\n\"I can\\'t shake hearing people scream in terror as the flames barreled down on us,\" Lowry said.\\nHis family and another evacuating with them tried to take U.S. 101 but found it blocked by flames, and had to take country roads to get to the family friends who took them in.\\nTo the south, in Orange County, more than 5,000 homes were evacuated because of a rapidly spreading brush fire in the Anaheim area. The blaze had grown to nearly 10 square miles and had destroyed dozens of structures.\\nThe blaze has scorched 6,000 acres and destroyed dozens of structures in Orange County.\\nPlumes of smoke were visible over Disneyland, and officials issued air quality warnings for parts of Los Angeles County.\\nAn Anaheim police spokesman says there\\'s been no containment so far.\\nAmong those fleeing the flames in Northern California were what the San Francisco Chronicle calls \"a who\\'s who of athletes -- Olympians, Hall of Famers.\"\\nThe newspaper says they\\'d gathered to attend retired football star Ronnie Lott\\'s celebrity fundraiser at Mayacama Golf Club in Santa Rosa.\\n\"Former Giants outfielder Barry Bonds wound up shuttling guests who did not have rides away from Mayacama when the villas at the course were evacuated,\" the Chronicle reports. \"Longtime Kansas City pitcher Bret Saberhagen left his golf clubs in the parking lot in order to fit Olympic speedskater Dan Jansen and his wife into his rental car.

One hillside home remained unscathed while a dozen surrounding it were destroyed.\\nKim Hoe, a 33-year-old tech worker from Penang, Malaysia, was staying at the Hilton Sonoma Wine Country, which was gutted by flames. He said the power went out around 1 a.m., and he and his colleagues started packing up when someone knocked on the door and told them to run.\\n\"We just had to run and run. It was full of smoke. We could barely breathe,\" Hoe said.\\nThe large majority of the injured were treated for smoke inhalation, according to St. Joseph Health, which operates hospitals in the Santa Rosa area. Two were in critical condition and one was in serious condition. The number of injured is expected to climb as information comes in for all the other areas affected by the firestorm consuming the state.\\nOctober has generally been the most destructive time of year for California wildfires. What was unusual Sunday, however, was to have so many fires take off at the same time.\\nOther than the windy conditions that helped drive them all, there was no known connection between the fires, and no cause has been released for any of them.\\nBut the conditions late Monday and early Tuesday were calmer than they were 24 hours earlier, bringing hopes of progress against the flames.\\nGov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for the fire areas, and asked the federal government to do the same.

      "features:b'As President Barack Obama considers military action in response to Bashar al-Assad\\'s alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria, a debate over whether he must seek Congress\\' consent has surfaced. It\\'s a debate with which the president is extremely familiar.\\nAs a senator, Obama was a staunch critic of President George W. Bush for not obtaining renewed authorization for the war in Iraq. He blasted his predecessor in 2007, saying, \"The president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.\"\\nAdditionally, as a candidate for president, Obama reaffirmed that sentiment. He told the Boston Globe in a questionnaire, \"The president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.\"\\n\"It is always preferable to have the informed consent of Congress prior to any military action,\" Obama added at the time.\\nSyria: Western intervention looms after reported chemical attack\\nAs a senator, Vice President Joe Biden had a similar take. During a campaign speech in Iowa in 2007, he said \"the consequences of war -- intended or otherwise -- can be so profound and complicated that our founding fathers vested in Congress, not the president, the power to initiate war, except to repel an imminent attack on the United States or its citizens.\"\\nAlthough they have held such strong views in the past, their positions have dramatically changed. They did not seek Congressional consent when the United States engaged its military in Libya, nor when Obama expanded the war in Afghanistan. In both instances, members of Congress complained loudly, but the president defended his decision.\\nIran: U.S. military action in Syria would spark \\'disaster\\'\\nIn the case of Libya, the president said at the time that U.S. troops would not be on the ground and so the law didn\\'t apply.\\nWhy the change of heart?\\n\"Where you stand on this issue depends on where you sit, and right now (Obama) is sitting in the Oval Office,\" said Kal Raustiala, professor of law at UCLA.\\nIt\\'s a long-running battle of checks and balances. And it\\'s one that the president usually wins.\\nOpinion: On Syria, learn from U.S. mistakes in Iraq\\nThe debate revolves around the War Powers Resolution.\\nCongress passed the measure in 1973, overriding a veto by President Richard Nixon. It was meant to rein in the president\\'s ability to involve the United States in overseas conflict.\\nThe law requires that the president seek consent from Congress before force is used or within 60 days of the start of hostilities and that the president provides Congress with reports throughout the conflict.\\nIt hasn\\'t really worked that way.\\nMany in Congress want consultation before action in Syria\\nIt\\'s a debate that has played out time and time again in U.S. history: a president is considering intervening in an international conflict, Congress wants a say. Specifically, congressional opponents want the ability to block the intended military action.\\nSince 1973, the United States has used military force in Grenada in 1983, Panama in 1989, Iraq in 1991, Haiti in 1994 and Kosovo in 1999. In all those instances, presidents -- both Democrats and Republicans -- sidestepped Congress and committed U.S. military forces without obtaining Congressional approval.\\nCongress did, however, provide Bush with its approval for the war in Iraq in 2002 and the war in Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks.\\nLike a replay of the past, some members of Congress are demanding the president seek the legislative branch\\'s approval before any action is taken in Syria. But it\\'s highly unlikely the president will take that formal step.\\nWarnings of quagmire in Syria as U.S. contemplates military action\\nCongress complains, sometimes loudly, but has rarely done anything about it. It could pass laws further restricting the president\\'s authority, but hasn\\'t done so. The legislative branch could also withhold funding of any military conflict, but that\\'s another avenue it has failed to take. Additionally, the judiciary has been reluctant to settle the dispute.\\nIn the White House\\'s daily briefing, press secretary Jay Carney said the administration is consulting with Congress. Obama \"had discussions with relevant members of Congress, and leaders of committees and leaders of the Congress at large,\" he said.\\nWho wants what after chemical weapons horror\\nIn response to Carney\\'s statement, Rep. Justin Amash, R-Michigan, who called military action without congressional approval \"unconstitutional\" and is among a group of lawmakers who are demanding the president seek their approval, tweeted, \"yeah right.\"\\nBut while members are likely to write letters, pontificate and even challenge the president to seek consent, the president is likely to continue to sit on the winning side of the issue.\\nTIME.com: What Obama can and can\\'t do' target:-1\n",

Number one, this administration is stupid, simple as that. Number two, this administration is on the receiving end of some of the worst intelligence in American history.

Indeed, former CIA Director David Petraeus testified to the Committee on November 16, 2012, \"They went through the normal process that talking points-unclassified public talking points-go through.\" In fact, the purpose of the National Security Council (NSC) is to coordinate the many national security agencies of the government, especially when information about a terrorist attack is flowing in and being analyzed quickly-and the NSC used this role appropriately in the case of the talking points coordination. Furthermore, such coordination processes were also standardized, often at the urging of Congress, following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks with the explicit goal of reducing information \"stovepipes\" between and among agencies.

It didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. And the president isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t about to let that go unnoticed.\\nHe joins a large U.S. delegation that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s already shaking things up. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sent the greenback tumbling yesterday when he said a weaker dollar isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a concern and actually would be good for trade. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that the U.S. was already in a trade war, a day after Trump said it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\nLook for the president to boast about U.S. economic performance during his first year in office \\xe2\\x80\\x94 unemployment down, the stock market up, robust growth.\\nBut accomplishing the central goal of his visit will require a bit more nuance. Can the bombastic president, prone to going off script, convince the Davos audience in a major speech tomorrow that his populist \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAmerica First\\xe2\\x80\\x9d policies can co-exist with globalism?\\nDavos, Day 3 | Theresa May is among today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s main headliners. The U.K. prime minister and Israeli Premier Benjamin Netanyahu each have bilateral meetings scheduled with Trump at the Swiss Alp gathering. Check our special hub page for all the latest news and features from the forum.\\nMueller moving quickly | U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is moving faster than expected and appears to be wrapping up at least one key part of his investigation \\xe2\\x80\\x94 whether Trump obstructed justice. The president told reporters during an impromptu session at the White House yesterday he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9clooking forward\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to speaking to Mueller under oath and suggested that may happen in two to three weeks.\\nPath to citizenship | At the same briefing, Trump said he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s open to giving young undocumented immigrants a 10- to 12-year path to citizenship in a deal with Congress, though an administration official later emphasized the idea is only a discussion point so far. Meanwhile, a group of mayors boycotted an infrastructure meeting with Trump to protest his hard-line immigration policies.\\nMiddle East tensions | Yesterday it was Trump, today his homeland security adviser spoke out. Frustrations in Washington over Turkey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in northern Syria are coming to the boil. White House aide Tom Bossert warned of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgrave consequences\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from any Turkish miscalculation as growing tensions between the NATO allies push the Ankara government closer to Russia and Iran.\\nChina\\xe2\\x80\\x99s investment pushback | The Chinese official who oversees $24 billion of state-owned corporate assets accused the Trump administration of discriminating against his country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s investment plans. Xiao Yaping made his plea for fair treatment in an interview with Bloomberg, even as a top Treasury official warned senators legislation is needed to bolster U.S. controls on foreign investment.\\nFundraiser fallout | Male business leaders and government attendees of London\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Presidents Club Charity Dinner are rushing to explain, defend themselves against or brush off a Financial Times report that multiple hostesses at the men-only event were harassed, groped and insulted. Joe Mayes and Kitty Donaldson look at the row.\\nAnd finally... While Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in Davos pitching India as a global investment destination, just 80 kilometers from New Delhi in the village of Dhamaka, where many still cook over open fires, residents were worrying about a lack of jobs and their deepening debt trap.

      "features:b'ANALYSIS/OPINION:\\nPresident Trump leveled an unproven allegation this weekend that former President Barack Obama tapped his phones at Trump Tower a month before the election.\\nNews outlets are lamenting the lack of proof, with some pundits asserting Mr. Trump made up the entire affair as a way to vent his anger about Attorney General Jeff Sessions\\xe2\\x80\\x99 decision to recuse himself from any ongoing Russian investigations.\\nMost journalists are just dismissing the allegations as a lie.\\nThere are many reasons to question Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charges, but still, there are many reasons to take them seriously. Below is a list of why some Republicans are wary at the Democratic response so far, and why Mr. Trump may have a point.\\n1\\\\. Wiretapping was essential in retrieving the conversations of retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and the Russian ambassador, which led to Gen. Flynn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s resignation as Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s national security adviser.\\nAccording to The New York Times: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Flynn, who served in the job for less than a month, said he had given \\xe2\\x80\\x98incomplete information\\xe2\\x80\\x99 regarding a telephone call he had with the [Russian] ambassador in late December about American sanctions against Russia, weeks before President Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inauguration.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nHow was it discovered that Mr. Flynn gave this \\xe2\\x80\\x9cincomplete information?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Because either a transcript or actual recording of the call were overheard by FBI officials and leaked to reporters.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unclear whether the FBI \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which uses Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants to eavesdrop \\xe2\\x80\\x94 had tapped the Russian Ambassador\\xe2\\x80\\x99s phone or Mr. Flynn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. This is because \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\n2\\\\. On Oct. 15, 2016, the BBC reported that the U.S. secret intelligence court issued a warrant to investigate two Russian banks in conjunction with the Trump Organization.\\nThe BBC report was corroborated by Heat Street, which reported the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFBI sought, and was granted, a FISA court warrant in October, giving counter-intelligence permission to examine the activities of \\xe2\\x80\\x98U.S. persons\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in Donald Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign with ties to Russia.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nHowever, The New York Times and The Washington Post \\xe2\\x80\\x94 along with other mainstream outlets \\xe2\\x80\\x94 haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been able to confirm. But they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gotten close.\\nAccording to The New York Times: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the fall, the FBI examined computer data showing an odd stream of activity between a Trump Organization server and Alfa Bank, one of Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s biggest banks, whose owners have long-standing ties to Mr. [Vladimir] Putin. While some FBI officials initially believed that the computer activity indicated an encrypted channel between Moscow and New York, the bureau ultimately moved away from that view. The activity remains unexplained.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThere is no confirmed evidence \\xe2\\x80\\x94 other than the BBC and Heat Street reports \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that the FBI got a court warrant to get a wiretap on the Trump Organization or to target specific individuals within Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign, like Mr. Flynn.\\nBut no confirmed evidence, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not out there, just waiting to be exposed by more mainstream outlets.\\n3\\\\. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has lied about U.S. surveillance and wiretapping under oath.\\nMr. Clapper offered a full-throated denial of any wiretapping on Trump Tower on Sunday. However, he also denied, under oath and in front of Congress, the scope of the National Security Agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surveillance of the American people.\\nIn an exchange with Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden in March 2013, Mr. Clapper was asked \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in a yes-or-no question \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoes the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions, or hundreds of millions of Americans?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nHis response: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMr. Wyden pushed \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt does not?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMr. Clapper responded: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot wittingly. There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn June, NSA leaker Edward Snowden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dump of information revealed the government was in fact doing just that. Later, when asked what triggered Mr. Snowden into releasing the information, he responded it was Mr. Clapper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2013 testimony, where he \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdirectly lie[d] under oath to Congress \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 seeing that really meant for me there was no going back.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIf he lied back then, why couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he be lying today?\\n3\\\\. Mr. Obama issued a carefully worded non-denial.\\nMr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement just said that neither he or the White House ordered the wiretapping \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not that Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s organization wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tapped.\\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice. As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nDavid French, at the National Review, pointed out three ways that this non-denial was disingenuous. First, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s technically the FISA court that orders such surveillance, along with the Justice Department (not Mr. Obama or the White House). The real question is whether Mr. Obama sought such authorization.\\nSecondly, Mr. Obama has ordered surveillance against American citizens. Mr. French argues, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe notion that Obama would never have an American subject to surveillance is absurd.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He cites drone strikes overseas.\\nLastly, FISA national security investigations are different than criminal investigations, in that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re covert and require a presidential sign-off.\\nAs Mr. French notes: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne of the points in FISA proceedings\\xe2\\x80\\x99 being classified is that they remain secret \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the idea is not to prejudice an American citizen with publication of the fact that he has been subjected to surveillance even though he is not alleged to have engaged in criminal wrongdoing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n4\\\\. Mr. Obama expanded NSA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s powers in the days before leaving office.\\nMr. Obama, in his final days, allowed the NSA to share globally intercepted personal communications with the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s other 16 intelligence agencies before applying privacy protections, The New York Times reported.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe new rules significantly relax longstanding limits on what the N.S.A. may do with the information gathered by its most powerful surveillance operations, which are largely unregulated by American wiretapping laws,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The Times reported. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese include collecting satellite transmissions, phone calls and emails that cross network switches abroad, and messages between people abroad that cross domestic network switches.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nLast week, The Times reported the Obama administration rushed to spread all evidence it collected about Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s meddling in the U.S. election and about possible contacts of people within Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign and Russian officials, to \\xe2\\x80\\x9d to leave a clear trail of intelligence for government investigators.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n5\\\\. Journalists readily believe the Trump-Kremlin international conspiracy to rig the U.S. election, but immediately put down the idea the Obama DOJ using FISA against Mr. Trump.\\nUnsubstantiated and anonymously sourced reports have continued to trickle in the news media about Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team\\xe2\\x80\\x99s collusion with Russian officials, without any actual evidence. Mr. Clapper, of whom most journalists are using to vehemently deny any wiretapping on Trump Tower, also said the DNI found no collusion between Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team and Russia.\\nThe media, conveniently picking and choosing what they want to report or what leads they want to follow, reeks of media confirmation bias.\\nCopyright \\xc2\\xa9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

The Jones Act requires that all goods shipped between U.S. ports be carried by U.S.-owned and operated ships, which are more expensive vessels than others in the global marketplace. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s meant that Puerto Rico pays double the costs to import goods from the U.S. mainland compared with neighboring islands \\xe2\\x80\\x95 and that U.S. vessels are making bank.\\nThe return to higher shipping costs won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help Puerto Rico as it tries to climb out of economic devastation. Nearly half of the 3.4 million Americans on the island still don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have drinking water since Maria hit nearly three weeks ago. Just 15 percent have electricity. Many people still haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t heard from loved ones, and at least 39 deaths have been attributed to the storm.\\nLapan said DHS is \\xe2\\x80\\x9calways prepared to review requests on a case-by-case basis and respond quickly\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to possible waivers of the Jones Act. But those decisions have to be related to national defense, he said, and are not driven by cost-related matters.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe believe that extending the waiver is unnecessary to support the humanitarian relief efforts on the island,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lapan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is an ample supply of Jones Act-qualified vessels to ensure that cargo is able to reach Puerto Rico.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nDespite DHS\\xe2\\x80\\x99 position, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello said Monday night that he wants another extension of the Jones Act waiver.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think we should have it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rossello told CBS News\\xe2\\x80\\x99 David Begnaud. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn this emergency phase, while we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking to sustain and save lives, we should have all of the assets at hand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nPresident Donald Trump, who is spending Monday golfing, had originally hedged on waiving the Jones Act for Puerto Rico at all, saying \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca lot of shippers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want him to do it. He eventually caved to pressure from lawmakers including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).\\nMcCain has been pushing to get rid of the Jones Act altogether. It costs Puerto Rico hundreds of millions of dollars every year, and he recently introduced legislation to nix the law.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow that the temporary Jones Act waiver for Puerto Rico has expired, it is more important than ever for Congress to pass my bill to permanently exempt Puerto Rico from this archaic and burdensome law,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d McCain said in a statement to HuffPost. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUntil we provide Puerto Rico with long-term relief, the Jones Act will continue to hinder much-needed efforts to help the people of Puerto Rico recover and rebuild from Hurricane Maria.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThis article has been updated with comment from the Puerto Rican governor on the need for another waiver.' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'Kevin Corke reports from the White House\\nA lawyer for Donald Trump Jr. late Monday dismissed a New York Times report that the president&aposs eldest son knew that potentially damaging information on Hillary Clinton was offered as part of a Russian government effort to assist his father in last year&aposs election.\\nThe paper reported that music publicist Rob Goldstone indicated in an email to Trump Jr. that the Kremlin was the source of information about purported illegal campaign contributions to the Democratic National Committee provided by attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya.\\n\"In my view, this is much ado about nothing,\" said attorney Alan Futerfas, who said that Goldstone had contacted Trump Jr. late in the Republican primary campaign and \"suggested that people had information concerning alleged wrongdoing\" by Clinton.\\n\"The meeting [with Veselnitskaya] lasted about 20-30 minutes and nothing came of it,\" Futerfas went on. \"His father knew nothing about it. The bottom line is that Don Jr. did nothing wrong.\"\\nThe White House referred questions to the president&aposs son. Mark Corallo, a spokesman for the president&aposs outside legal team, would not comment on the Times story, reiterating only that the president \"was not aware of and did not attend the meeting.\"\\nDemocratic National Committee spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said the Times report proved \"Donald Jr. was willing to accept the help of a hostile foreign government to sway the election. In the ensuing months, the Trump family watched as news of the Kremlin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hacking campaign developed and they did nothing but celebrate and encourage it to continue.\\n\"It is time for Donald Trump, his family, and his team to stop lying and come clean about their contacts with Russia, what they knew about the Kremlin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s effort to help them, and when they knew it,\" Watson added.\\nGoldstone confirmed earlier Monday that he had set up the meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya on behalf of his client, singer Emin Agalarov.\\nIn a statement Sunday, Trump Jr. acknowledged taking the meeting to learn damaging information about Clinton, but claimed that Veselnitskaya allegations were \"vague, ambiguous and made no sense\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbecame clear that she had no meaningful information.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe Times story, which cited three unnamed people with knowledge of Goldstone&aposs email but did not relate the actual email text, was the third report in as many days concerning the meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya.\\nIn response to a Times report published Saturday, Trump Jr. said the meeting was primarily about allowing Americans to adopt Russian children and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmentioned nothing about Mrs. Clinton.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Responding to the paper&aposs Sunday report, Trump Jr. acknowledged that he was told Veselnitskaya \"might have information helpful to the campaign.\"\\nThe Veselnitskaya meeting, which was also attended by Trump&aposs then-campaign manager Paul Manafort and adviser Jared Kushner, is the first confirmed private meeting between members of President Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inner circle and a Russian national. If the content of Goldstone&aposs email is confirmed, it would be the first public word that Trump Jr. had been made aware the material could have been emanating from the Kremlin.\\nDmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Monday the Kremlin doesn&apost know Veselnitskaya and \"cannot keep track\" of every Russian lawyer who holds meetings in Russia or abroad. Although she has not been publicly linked with the Russian government itself, Veselnitskaya represented the son of a vice president of state-owned Russian Railways in a New York money-laundering case settled in May before a trial.\\nTrump spent time with Agalarov during his visit to Moscow for the 2013 Miss Universe pageant, which Trump owned at the time. The real estate mogul appeared in a music video with Agalarov and several pageant contestants. Agalarov&aposs father, Aras, is a Russian developer who sought to partner with Trump on a hotel project in Moscow and tried to set up a meeting between Trump and Putin during the Miss Universe contest.\\nEarlier Monday, Trump Jr. tried to brush off the significance of the meeting, tweeting sarcastically, \"Obviously I&aposm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent ... went nowhere but had to listen.\"\\nTrump Jr. also said on Twitter he was willing to work with the Senate Intelligence Committee, one of the panels probing possible campaign collusion, \"to pass on what I know.\"\\nLawmakers on the committee from both parties said they indeed wanted to talk with the president&aposs son. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the panel \"needs to interview him and others who attended the meeting.\" Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., agreed, saying, \"Based on his own admissions, this is an attempt at collusion.\"\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.' target:1\n",

Comey, the former F.B.I. director, from providing potentially damaging testimony to Congress on statements the president made about an investigation into his former national security adviser, two senior administration officials said Friday.\\nMr. Trump could still move to block the testimony next week, given his history of changing his mind at the last minute about major decisions. But legal experts have said that Mr. Trump has a weak case to invoke executive privilege because he has publicly addressed his conversations with Mr. Comey, and any such move could carry serious political risks.\\nOne of the administration officials said Friday evening that Mr. Trump wanted Mr. Comey to testify because the president had nothing to hide and wanted Mr. Comey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statements to be publicly aired. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified discussing a decision that had not been announced.\\nA White House spokesman did not respond to a message seeking comment.

McGahn II, saying there was no case for the president to exert the privilege on Mr. Comey.\\nInvoking executive privilege can be a politically treacherous move, recalling past scandals like Watergate, in which President Richard M. Nixon asserted the power in efforts to block congressional investigations. President Barack Obama used the legal authority once, during congressional inquiries after weapons ended up in the possession of Mexican gun cartels.\\nPresidents have often moved to keep their records and other communications with senior officials private until they leave office, on the theory that confidentiality is crucial to their ability to receive unvarnished advice on sensitive matters. But seeking a restraining order barring testimony by Mr. Comey, who is now a private citizen, would be unprecedented.\\nMr. Comey is expected to testify about several conversations he had with the president, including one in which Mr. Trump encouraged him to stop investigating his former national security adviser, Michael T.

So that&aposs still being vetted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn the original Oct. 26 Fox News report, sources at the annex said that the CIA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Global Response Staff had handed over three Libyan militia members to the Libyan authorities who came to rescue the 30 Americans in the early hours of Sept. 12.\\nA well-placed Washington source confirms to Fox News that there were Libyan militiamen being held at the CIA annex in Benghazi and that their presence was being looked at as a possible motive for the staged attack on the consulate and annex that night.\\nAccording to multiple intelligence sources who have served in Benghazi, there were more than just Libyan militia members who were held and interrogated by CIA contractors at the CIA annex in the days prior to the attack. Other prisoners from additional countries in Africa and the Middle East were brought to this location.\\nThe Libya annex was the largest CIA station in North Africa, and two weeks prior to the attack, the CIA was preparing to shut it down. Most prisoners, according to British and American intelligence sources, had been moved two weeks earlier.\\nThe CIA, though, categorically denied these allegations, saying: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe CIA has not had detention authority since January 2009, when Executive Order 13491 was issued.

She suggests in her Denver speech that Petraeus knew almost immediately that the attack was a terror attack -- possibly to free militia members.\\nA few days later, Petraeus testified in a closed session to Congress that the attack was due in large part to an anti-Islam video and a spontaneous uprising, according to reports from the hearing.\\nCongressional leaders say privately they believe they were lied to by Petraeus when he testified shortly after the attack. Some of these members already considered charging Petraeus with perjury, but said they planned to withhold judgment until he testified this week. After resigning as CIA director, the CIA said Acting Director Mike Morrell would testify in his place.\\nAll of this raises the question: What was the CIA really doing in Benghazi in addition to searching for Qaddafi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stash of more than 22,000 shoulder-held missiles that could bring down commercial airplanes, and who in the White House knew exactly what the CIA was up to?' target:1\n",
      "features:b'President Donald Trump appeared to defend his choice of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general in a Friday night tweet, despite previously denying he even knew the man at the helm of the Justice Department. His future, though, is uncertain as the Senate\\'s top Republican is predicting a permanent replacement could be named soon for Whitaker, who\\'s now overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s investigation into possible ties between Russia and Trump\\'s 2016 presidential campaign. The comments Friday from Trump about not knowing Whitaker and those from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., came as Whitaker\\'s past business ties and remarks on Mueller\\'s probe and other topics drew scrutiny from Democrats and ethics groups. \"I don\\'t know Matt Whitaker,\" Trump told reporters at the White House before leaving on a trip to France. That contradicted Trump\\'s remarks on Fox News last month, when he called Whitaker \"a great guy\" and said, \"I mean, I know Matt Whitaker.\" McConnell, separately, said, \"I think this will be a very interim AG.\" And Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she was concerned by some of Whitaker\\'s past comments and called for legislation that would place limits on his ability to fire Mueller. That would include specifying that only a Senate-confirmed Justice Department official, which Whitaker is not, could dismiss the special counsel. Whitaker, a Republican Party loyalist and chief of staff to just-ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions, was elevated Wednesday after Sessions was forced from his job by Trump. Since Wednesday, Whitaker has faced pressure from Democrats to step aside from overseeing Mueller, based on critical comments Whitaker made about the investigation before joining the Justice Department last year. Whitaker wrote an op-ed article saying Mueller would be straying outside his mandate if he investigated Trump family finances. Whitaker also gave a talk radio interview in which he maintained there was no evidence of collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign. He also tweeted an ex-prosecutor\\'s opinion piece that described a \"Mueller lynch mob\" and said it was \"worth a read.\" There have been reports about Whitaker\\'s past comments questioning the power and reach of the federal judiciary, and about his ties to an invention-promotion company that was accused of misleading consumers. The Wall Street Journal on Friday published an email revealing an FBI investigation into the company, World Patent Marketing Inc. The July 10, 2017, email was from an FBI victims\\' specialist to someone who, the newspaper said, was an alleged victim of the company. A Justice Department spokeswoman told the Journal that Whitaker was \"not aware of any fraudulent activity.\" Also Friday, The Associated Press reported that Whitaker repeatedly chided Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in public statements during 2016 while he was speaking for a group that is barred by its tax-exempt status from supporting or opposing political candidates during a campaign. Whitaker has tried to stay out of the public debate. He sent a department-wide note after his appointment in which he said, \"As we move forward, I am committed to leading a fair Department with the highest ethical standards, that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans.\" Legal scholars are debating the constitutionality of his appointment. Some lawyers say it is illegal because he has not been confirmed by the Senate. Even as Trump seems to be distancing himself from Whitaker, two Republicans close to the president said Trump had enjoyed Whitaker\\'s TV appearances and the two had struck a bond. Those TV appearances included one on CNN in which Whitaker suggested that the Mueller probe could be starved of resources. Trump told associates that he felt Whitaker would be \"loyal\" and would not have withdrawn from the Russia probe, as Sessions had done, according to the Republicans. They were not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations and spoke on condition of anonymity. Trump said Friday he had not spoken with Whitaker about Mueller\\'s investigation, which until now has been overseen by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Later in the day, Trump tweeted that he did not personally know Whitaker, a former federal prosecutor in Iowa, but several Republican leaders in that state respected him. \"I feel certain he will make an outstanding Acting Attorney General!\" Rosenstein told reporters Friday that based on his experiences with Whitaker, \"I think he\\'s a superb choice for attorney general.\" Of the scrutiny Whitaker is facing, Trump said, \"It\\'s a shame that no matter who I put in they go after.\" \"He was very, very highly thought of, and still is highly thought of, but this only comes up because anybody that works for me, they do a number on them,\" Trump said. McConnell said he expects Trump to nominate a new permanent attorney general \"pretty quickly.\" McConnell said he expects Whitaker to be \"a very interim\" appointee. \"The president has said repeatedly he\\'s not going to dismiss the Mueller investigation,\" McConnell told reporters at Kentucky\\'s Capitol. \"He\\'s said repeatedly it\\'s going to be allowed to finish. That also happens to be my view.\" Trump has not said whom he will nominate to permanently replace Sessions. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is said to be a candidate, along with Labor Secretary Alex Acosta and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, among others. Trump told reporters he has not discussed the post with Christie, who he said was \"a friend of mine\" and \"a good man.\"' target:1\n",

      "features:b'The fast-moving national reckoning over sexual harassment in the workplace toppled another television news star on Wednesday when NBC fired Matt Lauer, the co-host of its most profitable franchise, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cToday,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d after an allegation of inappropriate sexual behavior with a subordinate.\\nThe downfall of Mr. Lauer, a presence in American living rooms for more than 20 years, adds to a head-spinning string of prominent firings over sexual harassment and abuse allegations. NBC News said it had decided to dismiss its star morning anchor after a woman met with network executives on Monday to describe her interactions with him.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhile it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over 20 years he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been at NBC News, we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Andrew Lack, the NBC News chairman, wrote in a memo to staff.\\nOn Wednesday, NBC received at least two more complaints related to Mr. Lauer, according to a person briefed on the network\\xe2\\x80\\x99s handling of the matter. One complaint came from a former employee who said Mr. Lauer had summoned her to his office in 2001, locked the door and sexually assaulted her. She provided her account to The New York Times but declined to let her name be used.\\nShe told The Times that she passed out and had to be taken to a nurse. She said that she felt helpless because she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to lose her job, and that she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t report the encounter at the time because she felt ashamed.\\nOn Thursday, Mr. Lauer issued an apology, expressing \\xe2\\x80\\x9csorrow and regret for the pain I have caused.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nNews of Mr. Lauer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sudden downfall shook the television world, where he had established himself as one of the most powerful men in his industry. Even President Trump \\xe2\\x80\\x94 who himself has denied multiple allegations of sexual misconduct \\xe2\\x80\\x94 weighed in, seizing on Mr. Lauer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s firing to denounce NBC News\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coverage and call for other senior figures at NBC News to be ousted.\\nMr. Lauer, 59, joins an ignominious group of media figures felled by the recent spate of harassment claims, including the studio mogul Harvey Weinstein, the comedian Louis C.K., the CBS host Charlie Rose and the political journalist Mark Halperin. Journalists at several news outlets had recently conducted interviews with former and current NBC employees about Mr. Lauer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behavior, alerting the network to potential articles about him. But it was the formal complaint on Monday that prompted NBC to take action.\\nIn an editorial meeting on Wednesday, Mr. Lack said that Mr. Lauer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s involvement with the woman who made the complaint began while they were in Sochi, Russia, to cover the Winter Olympics in 2014, and that their involvement continued after they returned to New York, according to two people briefed on the meeting.\\nOther \\xe2\\x80\\x9cToday\\xe2\\x80\\x9d hosts learned of Mr. Lauer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s termination around 4 a.m. on Wednesday; staff members were told just minutes before the show went on the air at 7 a.m. Savannah Guthrie, Mr. Lauer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s co-anchor, was visibly shaken when she delivered the news to viewers, describing Mr. Lauer as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca dear, dear friend\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and adding that she was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cheartbroken for the brave colleague who came forward to tell her story.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSoon after announcing the dismissal, Ms. Guthrie gripped the hand of Hoda Kotb, who was rushed in as an emergency substitute host. The network did not name a replacement for Mr. Lauer.\\nAri Wilkenfeld, a civil rights lawyer with the firm Wilkenfeld, Herendeen & Atkinson in Washington, said on Wednesday that he represented the woman who had made the initial complaint to NBC, but declined to identify her. In a statement provided to The Times, he praised the courage of his client and said:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy client and I met with representatives from NBC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s human resources and legal departments at 6 p.m. on Monday for an interview that lasted several hours. Our impression at this point is that NBC acted quickly, as all companies should, when confronted with credible allegations of sexual misconduct in the workplace.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe woman met with reporters from The Times on Monday, but said she was not ready to discuss it publicly.\\nBesides his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cToday\\xe2\\x80\\x9d perch, Mr. Lauer was a genial co-host of events like the Macy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Thanksgiving Parade and the Winter and Summer Olympics, and he conducted countless interviews with celebrities. He also contributed to NBC News\\xe2\\x80\\x99s political coverage, although he was widely panned after a debate last year in which he appeared to go easy on Mr. Trump while asking aggressive questions of Hillary Clinton.\\nThe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cToday\\xe2\\x80\\x9d show caters to \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and relies on \\xe2\\x80\\x94 an overwhelmingly female audience, and Mr. Lauer is part of a cast that presents itself as a tight-knit family. Behind the scenes, however, the on-set environment could sometimes resemble a boys\\xe2\\x80\\x99 club, particularly in the years before Comcast completed its acquisition of NBCUniversal in 2013, according to interviews with more than half a dozen former staff members.\\nJokes about women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appearances were routine, the former employees said. One former producer recalled a director saying he \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwanted some milk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in reference to one woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chest and making inappropriate comments about women over an audio feed with multiple people listening. Two former employees recalled colleagues playing a crude game in which they chose which female guests or staff members they would prefer to marry, kill or have sex with.\\nThe former employees spoke anonymously because they feared their career prospects in the industry could be harmed.\\nOther current and former staff members, however, described a more professional work culture, and said they did not witness harassment. An NBC spokeswoman declined on Wednesday to comment on the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cboys\\xe2\\x80\\x99 club\\xe2\\x80\\x9d characterization, but pointed out that 13 of 19 senior-level female producers at \\xe2\\x80\\x9cToday\\xe2\\x80\\x9d had been promoted since 2015.\\nThe woman who described the encounter in 2001 with Mr. Lauer in his office told The Times that the anchor had made inappropriate comments to her shortly after she started as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cToday\\xe2\\x80\\x9d producer in the late 1990s.\\nWhile traveling with Mr. Lauer for a story, she said, he asked her inappropriate questions over dinner, like whether she had ever cheated on her husband. On the way to the airport, she said, Mr. Lauer sat uncomfortably close to her in the car; she recalled that when she moved away, he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re no fun.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn 2001, the woman said, Mr. Lauer, who is married, asked her to his office to discuss a story during a workday. When she sat down, she said, he locked the door, which he could do by pressing a button while sitting at his desk. (People who worked at NBC said the button was a regular security measure installed for high-profile employees.)\\nThe woman said Mr. Lauer asked her to unbutton her blouse, which she did. She said the anchor then stepped out from behind his desk, pulled down her pants, bent her over a chair and had intercourse with her. At some point, she said, she passed out with her pants pulled halfway down. She woke up on the floor of his office, and Mr. Lauer had his assistant take her to a nurse.\\nThe woman told The Times that Mr. Lauer never made an advance toward her again and never mentioned what occurred in his office. She said she did not report the episode to NBC at the time because she believed she should have done more to stop Mr. Lauer. She left the network about a year later.\\nOn Wednesday, the episode in Mr. Lauer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office was reported to NBC News after the woman told her then-supervisor, who still works at the network. The woman said an NBC human resources representative had since contacted her.\\nThe woman, who was in her early 40s at the time, told her then-husband about the encounter, which The Times confirmed with him in a phone call. The couple was separated at the time, and later divorced. She also described it to a friend five years ago, which the friend confirmed to The Times.\\nNBC News has suffered other black eyes, as well. Last year, the network reviewed 2005 footage from the NBC-owned show \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAccess Hollywood\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that revealed Mr. Trump bragging about grabbing women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s genitalia. But the footage was released first by a competitor, The Washington Post, embarrassing the NBC news division.\\nIn recent weeks, NBC News was criticized for passing on an expos\\xc3\\xa9 of Mr. Weinstein by an MSNBC contributor, Ronan Farrow. Mr. Farrow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reporting later appeared in The New Yorker, and helped set off the current wave of revelations about abuses by powerful men in media and entertainment.' target:-1\n",

      "features:b'With a congressional hearing set for week\\'s end, President Obama vowed Monday to hold the Internal Revenue Service accountable if reports of political targeting turn out to be true.\\n\"If in fact IRS personnel engaged in the kind of practices that have been reported on and were intentionally targeting conservative groups, then that\\'s outrageous. And there\\'s no place for it,\" Obama told reporters.\\n\"And they have to be held fully accountable. Because the IRS as an independent agency requires absolute integrity, and people have to have confidence that they\\'re ... applying the laws in a nonpartisan way.\"\\nDocuments set to be released this week by the IRS watchdog show that the agency targeted tea party organizations and other groups focused on government spending and the federal debt that were seeking tax-exempt status.\\nThe IRS also applied extra scrutiny to applicants with statements that \"criticize how the country is run\" or that sought to educate the public on how to \"make America a better place to live,\" designations that would have included conservative political groups looking to apply for 501(c)(4) status. Those disclosures are included in the appendix of an inspector general\\'s report, obtained by CNN, that has caused widespread anger among lawmakers on both sides of the aisle as well as conservative groups.\\nCNNMoney: What\\'s behind the IRS flap\\nAn IRS official admitted Friday that the agency made \"mistakes\" in the past few years with tax-exempt status applications submitted by groups with the words \"tea party\" or \"patriot\" in their names. Multiple conservative groups have said their applications were delayed and returned with lengthy requests for supporting materials, sometimes including website printouts and lists of guest speakers.\\nObama said he learned of the allegations through news reports on Friday and didn\\'t want to comment on any findings by the Treasury Department inspector-general that oversees the IRS -- but if true, he said, \"It is contrary to our traditions, and people have to be held accountable, and it\\'s got to be fixed.\\n\"So we\\'ll wait and see what exactly all the details and the facts are,\" he said. \"But I\\'ve got no patience with it, I will not tolerate it, and I will make sure that we find out exactly what happened on this.\"\\nIRS chief to face Congress on Friday\\nThe Republican-led House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees the IRS, announced it would hold a hearing on the allegations Friday morning. Slated to testify are Steve Miller, the acting IRS commissioner; and the Treasury inspector-general investigating the complaints, J. Russell George.\\nMichigan Rep. Dave Camp, the committee\\'s Republican chairman, said the disclosure by the IRS \"is both astounding and appalling.\"\\n\"The Committee on Ways and Means will get to the bottom of this practice and ensure it never takes place again,\" Camp said in a statement announcing the hearings. Rep. Sander Levin, the panel\\'s ranking Democrat, added that \"a thorough and bipartisan investigation and effective remedial action\" was essential.\\nAnd in the Senate, Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus called for a full investigation as well.\\n\"We need to know who knew what, and exactly what mistakes were made,\" said Baucus, D-Montana. \"The American people have questions for the IRS and I intend to get answers.\"\\nIRS officials knew of agents\\' tea party targeting in 2011\\nIn 2010, Baucus called on the IRS to look into whether some groups were abusing their tax-exempt status by making politics their primary activity. Sen. Orrin Hatch, the committee\\'s top Republican, wrote a letter to Baucus calling for an immediate hearing.\\n\"Bipartisanship on this issue is critical since both Democrats and Republicans have expressed considerable interest in these matters over the past couple of years,\" Hatch wrote. \"As the sole committee of jurisdiction over the IRS, it is critical that Finance Committee play a leadership role in examining this issue.\"\\nFlood of tax-exempt claims followed court ruling\\nThe applications in question were processed by an office in Cincinnati that handles most applications for 501(c)(4) status and had seen the number of applications rise sharply beginning in 2010, the year of the Supreme Court\\'s Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling, which blessed unlimited campaign spending by corporations. Tax-exempt groups became a popular channel for the new wave of political spending.\\nMarcus Owens, the former director of the IRS division under fire, said the IRS receives about 60,000 applications for tax-exempt status every year. Most of them are from civic groups like parent-teacher associations, scout troops or sports leagues, and they\\'re quickly approved.\\nBut Owens said organizations seeking tax exemptions that appear to be involved in politics should get a closer look from the IRS based on their actions -- \"but not by name, like they were here, which was a mistake.\"\\nThe inspector-general\\'s report indicated the agency\\'s practice of singling out conservative groups began as early as March 2010, and in July of that year, unidentified managers within the agency \"requested its specialists to be on the lookout for tea party applications.\" In August, specialists were warned to be on the lookout for \"various local organizations in the tea party movement\" applying for tax-exempt status.\\nTimeline: IRS wrestled with which groups to scrutinize\\nIn June 2011, a briefing paper noted that groups focused on government spending and debt, as well as organizations criticizing how the government was being run, were also singled out for extra inspection. Officials at the Internal Revenue Service knew in June 2011 that their agents were targeting conservative groups for additional scrutiny on tax documents, the report indicates.\\nOwens said the IRS used to have a set of \"tripwire\" actions that drew the agency\\'s attention, but he said those standards were largely abandoned during a reorganization in the early 2000s. The reorganization was aimed at finding more money, and tax-exempt groups \"don\\'t produce any tax revenue for the government regardless.\"\\n\"What was wrong was using criteria that look like they were focused only on one end of the political spectrum,\" Owens said.\\nCraig Holman, who monitors campaign spending for the liberal watchdog group Public Citizen, said the \"vast majority\" of 501(c)4) groups are legitimate. But the others are \"primarily involved in elections\" and helped funnel more than $1.2 billion in secretive campaign money into the 2012 elections, and the IRS needs to crack down on them, he said.\\n\"They should not be partisan, or single out the tea party,\" Holman said. \"But they should look for political groups, and they\\'re not. They never prevented any of them from registering as nonprofit social welfare organizations.\"\\nAnd now that the issue has become a political hot potato, they\\'re not likely to, he said.\\n\"This controversy means they will never enforce the tax code,\" he said. \"We are going to see the IRS hide.\"\\nWho knew what, and when?\\nLois Lerner, the head of the Cincinnati-based IRS office that oversees tax-exempt groups, did not respond to requests for comment from CNN on Monday. Lerner is the IRS official who publicly admitted Friday that agents used the keywords \"tea party\" and \"patriot\" to flag applications for further review -- but she stressed that was done as a \"shortcut\" for picking the applications to review, not out of \"political bias.\"\\nLerner said in a Friday conference call that she \"did not feel comfortable answering\" as to when senior IRS officials became aware of the situation. She said the IRS has implemented changes to prevent similar mistakes in the future but could not say that any IRS employees had been disciplined.\\nBut a congressional source familiar with the inquiry understood that Lerner knew of the targeting in 2011 and sent letters to Congress this year without disclosing the extent of her knowledge. And Republicans are questioning why Miller -- who the IRS said was informed of the problem in May 2012 -- didn\\'t raise it when lawmakers asked questions about the issue the following June and July.\\n\"An apology is not sufficient,\" Camp said. \"There have been enough excuses and delays, and now it is time for the IRS to answer to the American people.\"\\nOpinion: IRS abuses power in targeting tea party\\nThe IRS did not respond to questions about why Miller didn\\'t inform Congress nor to questions about when its previous commissioner, Doug Shulman, found out. Shulman told a March 2012 Ways and Means hearing that his agency did not target conservative groups for political reasons.\\n\"I can give you assurances. We pride ourselves in being a nonpolitical, nonpartisan organization,\" said Shulman, who was appointed by President George W. Bush. \"There is absolutely no targeting. This is the kind of back and forth that happens when people apply for 501(c)(4) status.\"\\nThe IRS has told Congress that Shulman did not know about the targeting of conservative groups when he made that appearance, said Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for Hatch.' target:-1\n",

      "features:b'On the morning of March 11th, 2004, ten bombs exploded during the morning commute at Madrid\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Atocha train station. One hundred and ninety-two people were murdered and over 2,000 injured. Three days later, the government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar lost power in an election that swung suddenly to the Socialist Party.\\nThe attack, the deadliest in Spain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history, was seen by many as an al-Qaeda-inspired retaliation for the Aznar government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s support for the already unpopular U.S. invasion of Iraq. In jihadist lore, this is a legendary success story: a terror attack that inspired enough fear to swing a Western election.\\nThis story has been kicking around the back of my cabeza since Donald Trump won the Republican nomination, and I thought of it again after the explosion Saturday night in Chelsea. Demographic math and a basic failure by the celebrity demagogue to reach out beyond his base makes a general election win unlikely but hardly impossible. Trump can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be counted out until all the votes are counted.\\nThough he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a uniquely unqualified candidate, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been concerned about an outside X-Factor event suddenly changing the emotional calculus of the electorate in ways that we would later regret. This could be a sudden economic collapse or a cyber October-surprise. But terrorism has always seemed the prime known-unknown.\\nAfter all, terrorism is now a depressingly regular feature of American life. While no attacks have rivaled 9/11, we saw at least 45 thwarted terror plots in the first ten years after the destruction of the World Trade Center and in the last year alone suffered horrific losses in the San Bernardino and Orlando slaughters. But we have no template for the impact of an attack just before an American election.\\nWe are in a long war, a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgenerational struggle against radical jihadist terrorism,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as Hillary Clinton has repeatedly said. Many attacks have been the result of lone wolves, darkly inspired rather directed by centralized terror organizations, like the Boston bombing. This risk won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t evaporate overnight, no matter who is elected president in less than two months.\\nTrump has based his campaign on fear and anger of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cother,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d most infamously pledging to at least temporarily stop Muslim immigration to the United States (later dialed back to an ambiguous regional restriction). Fear of immigration, especially Muslim immigration, has been a mainstay not only of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign but also his European dopplegangers in UKIP and Le Pen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s National Front Party, which has been buoyed by repeated horrific jihadist attacks from Paris to Nice.\\nTrump rarely loses an opportunity to exploit terror. Within minutes of initial fog-of-war reports about Saturday night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s explosion in Chelsea, Trump told a crowd in Colorado Springs that a bomb had gone off in New York and while \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnobody knows exactly what\\'s going on but, boy we are really in a time\\xe2\\x80\\x94we better get tough folks.\" Always classy, he then touted a new poll showing him 4-points up.\\nHe has previously tried to make political hay of the San Bernardino and Orlando attacks, with less than successful results. But now we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re 50 days from the election and polls show the race is tightening. To some extent, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to be expected.\\nBut after months of primaries and analytic navel-gazing this is real time, with 29 people injured by an explosion in the heart of New York, just a few blocks from The Daily Beast\\xe2\\x80\\x99s headquarters. This came hours after an apparent IED exploded in Seaside, New Jersey, on the site of a U.S. Marine charity race, which had been mercifully delayed, curtailing casualties. There is still much we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know about both detonations, but New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement calling the Chelsea bomb was \\xe2\\x80\\x9can intentional act\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but adding \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe do not see a link to terrorism.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d A Saturday night stabbing of eight people at a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota, by a man in a security guard uniform was claimed by ISIS on Sunday morning, which issued a statement describing the assailant as \"a soldier of the Islamic State.\" This dark trifecta of weekend incidents one week after the anniversary of 9/11 all add to the drumbeat of anxiety which has driven many voters into the arms of Trump, someone they see as a strong man in chaotic times.\\nMore detailed information will come in over the coming hours and days. But there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reason to fear this pattern could continue between now and November. Whether it is the work of lone wolves or something more coordinated, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take Nostradamus to see that terrorists view President Trump as an asset in their efforts to portray America as discredited and in decline. His divisive instincts play perfectly into ISIS\\xe2\\x80\\x99 attempts to recast what used to be called The War on Terror as a war between America and Islam everywhere, rather than a rag-tag band of extremists, many radicalized remotely, parading under the broad banner of an apocalyptic death cult.\\nIf this pattern continuing sounds unlikely, consider the fact that America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s two biggest geo-political competitors, Russia and China, have been cheering the prospect of a Trump presidency, presumably because they see it as a harbinger of American decline and retreat from the world, despite all the tough guy rhetoric. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a helpful bit of historical symmetry that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAmerica First\\xe2\\x80\\x9d has consistently symbolized a flag-waving acquiescence to overseas dictators with bloody expansionist ambitions.\\nThe fact that so many of the Republican Party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s national security mandarins have declared Donald Trump unfit for office, should offer a reality check for reflexive Republicans and open-minded independents alike. The latest respected figure to join this chorus was former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, who wrote in the Wall Street Journal, \\xe2\\x80\\x9con national security, I believe Mr. Trump is beyond repair. He is stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government, and temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform\\xe2\\x80\\xa6He is unqualified and unfit to be commander in chief.\"\\nAgainst this unflattering backdrop, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tempting to say that the hawkish former Secretary of States Hillary Clinton could be in a better position to benefit if, God forbid, terror attacks continue through the election. After all, she has a demonstrated record on national security and far more detailed policy proposals on how to deal with ISIS, (which admittedly isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hard given Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s laughable talk of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csecret plan\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to the win the war.)\\nBut sexism impacts negative perceptions of Hillary Clinton just as racism fueled many of the unhinged criticisms of President Obama, especially the Birther conspiracy theories that Trump did so much to pump up over the past five years. We have no national template for a Golda Meir-type leader in our country. There will be many who are susceptible to the idea that an older woman can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t possible be as tough on terrorism as a blustery old man who loves to declare that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbomb the shit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d out of ISIS. \"Strong and wrong\" leaders have real emotional appeal during times of crisis. The certainty of the demagogue can be more compelling than the sober strategies offered by statesmen and stateswomen.\\nAs we get more information, it may be that these incidents are not connected with terrorism but the ensuing drumbeat of anxiety only adds to Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desire to declare himself a prophet who warned about terrorism and immigration before it was cool. This all falls into his fear-based wheelhouse.\\nTerrorism is one of the defining fights of our time. But terror, of course, is designed to elicit fear and change policy and behavior in ways that benefits terrorists. We unfortunately know that a precedent exists for terrorists impacting a western government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s elections. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need to steel ourselves and hope that Americans vote with their head as well as heart on November 8th.' target:-1\n",

They had never seen it rise like this, up near the tips of the light poles of the river walk park that meanders along its western bank. They had never seen a hole like the one that blew through the side of the nearby Columbia Canal.\\nEverywhere, it seemed, there was water where there should not have been.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heartbreaking,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Terry Carroll, 46, a carpenter and lifelong resident of the state, as he watched from an overlook on the Congaree\\xe2\\x80\\x99s east bank.\\nOn Monday, there was much that seemed broken in South Carolina \\xe2\\x80\\x94 except for the rain.

Nikki R. Haley said. Dams had burst and homes had been submerged and ruined, especially in and around Columbia, the state capital. A spokeswoman for the Department of Public Safety, Sherri Iacobelli, said Monday night that the storm had killed 11 people in the state. Seven deaths were weather-related drownings, she said, and four others were traffic fatalities linked to the storm.\\nMs. Haley was calling it an unprecedented event in South Carolina, and everyone seemed to agree. Mr. Carroll said that this stretch of the Congaree, which flows just west of downtown and the University of South Carolina campus, was usually so placid and low that one could walk across it.\\nHere and elsewhere, emergency crews \\xe2\\x80\\x94 who have already conducted hundreds of water rescues and at least 25 by air \\xe2\\x80\\x94 were rushing Monday to search more homes, restore infrastructure and power, and deliver drinking water.\\nThe rain \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the last throes of a pernicious storm system partly fed by moisture from Hurricane Joaquin, which in recent days has spun in the Atlantic far from the United States mainland \\xe2\\x80\\x94 was expected to end Tuesday. But Ms. Haley, in an early afternoon news conference, warned that South Carolina\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desperate time could be prolonged by record amounts of rain that had already fallen in much of the state, and must now flow toward the ocean.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is not over just because the rain stops,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt does not mean that we are out of the woods.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn historic Charleston, Columbia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coastal cousin to the south, the worst of the storms appeared to have passed Monday, after days of frayed nerves and waterlogged streets.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think the city is getting back to normal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said in a phone interview, noting that trash trucks ran on their Monday routes and sections of only two dozen streets were impassable. The Historic Charleston City Market, the four-block commercial hall for tourists, opened Monday morning, and retailers nearby were grumbling about the money they had lost on what should have been a busy tourist weekend.\\nBut at her news conference a few hours later, Ms. Haley emphasized that a large part of the state still faced problems. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are still very much in response mode when it comes to the Midlands down to the coast,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\nIn the Columbia area, potable water had become a precious commodity, even for those whose houses had not been damaged. Many residents who had water had been told to boil it. Others, on private wells, were worried that they would lose electricity, and thus the ability to pump.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo water?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Theresa Bartley, 73, a shopper at the Bi-Lo grocery store Monday afternoon in the suburb of Cayce, to Columbia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s southwest.\\nCorrect, came the reply.

Sold out.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve just got single bottles, hon,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said a clerk at the Family Dollar across the street, pointing toward a rare stash of about a dozen bottles at the bottom of a small cooler.\\nIn Hopkins, a town southeast of Columbia, the line for clean water outside Lower Richland High School was already 40 or 50 people deep Monday afternoon when cellphones began to sound their alarms: The authorities had issued a civil emergency message. Speculation spread that a dam had been breached.\\nThe school was one of four water distribution centers that Ms. Haley had promised. Six more will be ready by Tuesday, she said.\\nMany of the waiting residents said they, too, had tried to find water at grocery stores. As they waited, they traded stories of what they had seen on the news, or how they were already in battles with their insurance companies about leaking roofs or fallen trees.\\nThey quickly learned that their drinking water problems would not be easily solved, either.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe deal right now is 5 o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a National Guard captain shouted to the crowd at one point.\\nThe muffled groans began \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and then the captain dropped more bad news: He did not know if the water would be delivered in bottles, or whether residents would need their own containers.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expected to be this bad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Henry Caison, who lives in Columbia. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would have bought water, but it went out all of a sudden.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe authorities said that 25 shelters had opened statewide, housing more than 900 people. Eva Gadsden, a 72-year-old retired nurse, found herself among rows of cots Monday at St. Andrews Middle School here, nibbling on a disaster lunch special: a peanut butter sandwich and potato chips, along with a pouch of something called \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctropical punch flavored juice drink.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe rains had fallen all day Sunday over Ms. Gadsden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s apartment complex, but she figured the biggest problems were elsewhere. She was showering just before dinner when she heard shouts at her door.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGet out! Get out!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a police officer yelled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe water is coming in your apartment!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe authorities took Ms. Gadsden to four other shelters, she said, before she ended up at this one. The others were having their own water problems, she said.\\nThe experience was illustrative of the response here \\xe2\\x80\\x94 an improvisation, sometimes disorganized, but with a spirit of solidarity and neighborliness that Ms. Haley often trumpets as a hallmark of her state of 4.8 million people.\\nAs the evening progressed, Columbia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s TV channels were full of images of upended cars and reports of dam breaks and mandatory evacuations. A curfew was to be in effect in Columbia from 7 p.m. Monday to 6 a.m. Tuesday.\\nSoon after Mr. Carroll expressed his heartbreak overlooking the overrun Congaree, a small group of women were seen jogging a few yards away on Meeting Street, ponytails swinging behind them.

      "features:b'KCNAHow many \"kinetic military actions\" will it take for war skepticism to stick with the American public?\\nA new poll by the Chicago Council of Foreign Affairs (CCFA) finds that 75 percent of Americans believe that North Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x94a hermit kingdom thousands of miles away that is unable to keep its people from starving, a country whose military budget is a 60th the size of America\\'s\\xe2\\x80\\x94presents a critical threat to the United States. That\\'s up from 55 percent two years ago.\\nThese feelings don\\'t seem to be tempered by President Donald Trump\\'s historically low approval ratings, which currently stand at 38 percent. In the latest CBS survey, 62 percent of respondents say Trump\\'s behavior as president has decreased their confidence in his ability. The numbers aren\\'t better specifically on foreign policy: 61 percent say they\\'re \"uneasy\" about Trump\\'s ability to thwart North Korea.\\nThose numbers are unlikely to improve, as Trump responded to over-the-top threats North Korea regularly issues with one of his own this afternoon.\\n\"North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States,\" Trump told reporters at his golf club in New Jersey. \"They will be met with the fire and the fury like the world has never seen.\"\\nMeanwhile, the CCFA poll finds broad bipartisan support for more sanctions against North Korea. 76 percent of Americans favor increased sanctions, despite their limited effectiveness over the last decade-plus. 68 percent want sanctions extended to Chinese companies that work with North Korea.\\nReports that North Korea has successfully \"miniaturized\" a nuclear warhead for missile delivery overshadow progress on the diplomatic front. North Korean missile tests, too, are inevitably followed by successful U.S. missile defense tests.\\nYou might have expected the failures of the War on Terror to have mellowed the American public\\'s patience with military intervention. Instead, for the first time in 30 years, the CCFA poll found a majority of Americans supporting military action if North Korea attacked South Korea. Large majorities think North Korea shouldn\\'t be allowed even to keep those nuclear weapons it already has.\\nNorth Korea is unlikely to accept any arrangement where it cannot keep at the very least some of its weapons. The U.S. has taught the world some lessons about that in recent decades, and Pyongyang has been paying attention.\\nThe U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003 after George W. Bush\\'s administration insisted that the country possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and was determined to build more. No WMD program was found, but the Iraq war did have a knock-on effect on proliferation. By the end of 2003, Libyan dictator Moammar Qaddafi indicated an interest in voluntarily relinquishing his WMDs and WMD programs. There was a hope within the foreign policy establishment that countries such as Syria and Iran could be encouraged to do the same.\\nThe message changed dramatically when the U.S. helped depose Qaddafi in 2011. Libya\\'s post-disarmament experience made a powerful impression on any regime that may have been entertaining the idea of avoiding American military action by disarming. Indeed, it created a strong incentive to acquire WMDs, and to maintain a formidable military force, as a deterrent against U.S. aggression.\\nFor all the hype about the nutty young psychopath leading the North Korean regime, Pyongyang has been a relatively rational actor. For decades, the regime has adeptly manipulated the various regional powers and the U.S., allowing it to survive even as communism collapsed nearly everywhere else.\\nThe U.S., by contrast, has survived despite often acting in a less than rational fashion. The ocean buffer that sandwiches America has given us space to do that, as has our massive military superiority. From Vietnam to Afghanistan, the U.S. faces few real existential consequences for its ill-conceived actions.\\nTrump ran on a platform of questioning America\\'s security commitments around the world. While he has since embraced much of America\\'s role as world policemen, other countries remain understandably skeptical. This has led South Korea and even Japan to consider developing their own nuclear arsenals\\xe2\\x80\\x94a development that, counterintuitively, could go a long way in improving the prospects of peace in the region.\\nAmerican opinion, meanwhile, is working against peace. Coupled with Trump\\'s sinking approval ratings, the relatively widespread approval of a more aggressive approach in Korea could prompt Trump to drop any attempts at negotiation. Diplomacy is easy to mock, after all. War comes with a rally-\\'round-the-flag effect.\\nThis post was updated to include new comments by President Trump.' target:1\n",

At a rally in Fort Dodge, Iowa, the same month, Trump had delivered a similarly blistering attack on Carson.\\n\"If you\\'re a child molester, a sick puppy, a child molester, there\\'s no cure for that. There\\'s only one cure, and we don\\'t want to talk about that cure, that\\'s the ultimate cure. No there\\'s two, there\\'s death and the other thing. But if you\\'re a child molester, there\\'s no cure, they can\\'t stop you.

A shining example of overcoming poverty, he will put focus on dignity rather than dependence,\" Ryan tweeted.\\nBut Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, the Democratic ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, slammed the pick, calling Carson \"woefully unqualified.\"\\n\"[Trump] has no selected someone woefully unqualififed to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development. During his time in Baltimore, Dr. Ben Carson was a phenomenal neurosurgeon, but he has no experience developing housing policy affecting tens of millions of households or running a complex federal agency, as his own spokesman admitted just last month,\" the Maryland representative said in a statement.\\nCummings was referencing reports that Carson rejected a previous offer from Trump to be the next secretary of Health and Human services because he felt he was too inexperienced to run a federal agency, according to longtime aide Armstrong Williams. Responding to those reports, Williams had said, \"He\\'s never run an agency and it\\'s a lot to ask. He\\'s a neophyte and that\\'s not his strength.\"\\nCarson\\'s unsuccessful primary campaign was punctuated by rookie blunders and odd claims, including that the Egyptian pyramids were used to store grain. \"The pyramids were made in a way that they had hermetically sealed compartments,\" he said. \"You wouldn\\'t need hermetically sealed compartments for a sepulcher. You would need that if you were trying to preserve grain for a long period of time.\"\\nHe is known for offering provocative commentary on a wide range of issues, including comparing the modern American government to Nazi Germany in a March 2014 interview with Breitbart, and saying at the Voter Values Summit in 2013 that Obamacare is \"the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\"\\nCarson endorsed Trump shortly after he dropped out of the contest, becoming only the second former Republican candidate to do so after Gov. Chris Christie.\\nThe secretary of housing and urban development oversees federal public housing programs and helps formulate policy on homelessness and housing discrimination. As is the case with all cabinet secretaries, Carson needs to be confirmed by the Senate.\\nCarson had signaled he would be named to the job Wednesday afternoon, posting on Facebook that an announcement about his forthcoming role in the administration.\\n\"After serious discussions with the Trump transition team, I feel that I can make a significant contribution particularly to making our inner cities great for everyone,\" Carson wrote. \"We have much work to do in strengthening every aspect of our nation and ensuring that both our physical infrastructure and our spiritual infrastructure is solid.\"\\nTrump praised Carson as a \"greatly talented person\" in a tweet two weeks ago when he said he was considering Carson for the HUD position.\\n\"I am seriously considering Dr. Ben Carson as the head of HUD. I\\'ve gotten to know him well -- he\\'s a greatly talented person who loves people!\" Trump tweeted.\\nTrump promised during his campaign to prioritize the restoration of America\\'s inner cities, though he frequently courted controversy by using exaggerated rhetoric that painted a bleak portrait of minority communities.\\n\"The violence. The death. The lack of education. No jobs. We\\'re going to work with the African-American community and we\\'re going to solve the problem of the inner city,\" Trump said at a rally in Toledo, Ohio, in October. \"We\\'re going to bring safety back. You can\\'t walk out the street, you buy a loaf of bread and you end up getting shot. So we\\'re going to work very strongly with the African American community.\"\\nCarson was one of the large field of Republican presidential candidates. He enjoyed an early surge in the polls after he announced his campaign in May 2015 and ran mostly on his biography rather than policy. He bowed out of the race after a disappointing finish on Super Tuesday.\\nCarson admits that he had a violent temper in his youth, and says one of the defining moments of his life occurred when he was 14. Carson said he tried to stab a schoolmate, but the boy\\'s belt buckle blocked the knife. After praying for three hours, Carson \"came to an understanding that to lash out at people is not a sign of strength, it was a sign of weakness.\" A CNN report raised questions about Carson\\'s claims that he was violent and angry as a teenager.\\nWhen Carson -- a famed neurosurgeon -- became the director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins at age 33, he became the youngest person to head a major division in the hospital\\'s history.

      "features:b'Sen. Rand Paul just gave one of the most important speeches on foreign policy since George W. Bush declared war on Iraq. But instead of declaring war on another country, Paul declared war on his own party. Or, at least, its entire approach to foreign policy.\\nIn his address last night at the Center for the National Interest \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a think tank founded by Richard Nixon \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Paul gave, for the first time, a comprehensive picture of how he thinks about foreign policy. His moderate non-interventionism is a far cry from his father\\'s absolutist desire for America to exit the world stage. But Paul\\'s stance is light years away from the hyper-hawk neoconservatism that\\'s dominated Republican foreign policy thinking for decades.\\nPaul is signaling that, when he runs for president in 2016, he isn\\'t going to move toward the Republican foreign policy consensus; he\\'s going to run at it, with a battering ram. If he wins, he could remake the Republican Party as we know it. But if he loses, this speech may well be the reason.\\nPaul tacks to Obama\\'s right \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but not the way you think\\nIn the speech, Paul outlined four basic principles for conducting foreign policy.\\nFirst, \"war is necessary when America is attacked or threatened, when vital American interests are attacked and threatened, and when we have exhausted all other measures short of war.\" But not otherwise.\\nSecond, \"Congress, the people\\'s representative, must authorize the decision to intervene.\" No more war without express authorization.\\nThird, \"peace and security require a commitment to diplomacy and leadership.\" That means expanding trade ties and diplomatic links around the world.\\nFourth, \"we are only as strong as our economy.\" For Paul, the national debt and slow growth are national security crises.\\nIn the abstract, this doesn\\'t tell you a whole lot about what Paul believes. But when he gives specific examples of where he agrees and disagrees with Obama\\'s policy, the core idea becomes clearer: Paul wants to scale down American commitments to foreign wars.\\n\"the basic goal of the speech is to teach conservatives that they can oppose foreign wars and Democrats at the same time\"\\nPaul endorses the original decision to invade Afghanistan, but criticizes Obama\\'s decision to escalate it. He savaged the Libya intervention, calling Libya today \"a jihadist wonderland.\" He supports bombing ISIS, but blasted Obama\\'s decision to arm the Syrian rebels: \"the weapons are either indiscriminately given to \\'less than moderate rebels\\' or simply taken from moderates by ISIS.\"\\nBut Paul also, much more quietly, agrees with major parts of the Obama agenda. In a move that\\'s bound to infuriate Republican hardliners, he\\'s calling for negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program. He tacitly endorsed Obama\\'s sanction-and-negotiate approach to the Ukraine crisis. And he called for a peaceful, cooperative relationship with China.\\nIn Paul\\'s ideal world, America only very rarely engages in war. Most of its relations with foreign powers are conducted via diplomacy and trade with other states. This is hardly a detailed theory of how to conduct American foreign policy, but it is absolutely a conservative vision for ramping down America\\'s role in the world.\\nThe Obama-bashing reveals Paul\\'s real target: the GOP\\nSteven Jaffe/AFP/Getty Images\\nPaul\\'s real enemy. (Steven Jaffe/AFP/Getty Images)\\nPaul\\'s agenda has a lot more in common with Barack Obama\\'s view of the world than it does with, say, John McCain\\'s. But his speech very cleverly played up the criticisms of Obama, and minimized the points of agreement. That\\'s because the basic goal of the speech was to teach conservatives that they can oppose foreign wars and Democrats at the same time.\\nThe real target of Paul\\'s speech were the neoconservatives: the wing of the GOP that believes that American foreign policy should be about the aggressive use of American force and influence, be it against terrorist groups or Russia. Paul\\'s unsubtle argument is that this view, dominant in the GOP, is a departure from what a conservative foreign policy ought to be.\\nHis tactic for selling this argument is innovative. He\\'s reframed arguments with neoconservatives as arguments with Obama, banking on the idea that he can get everyday Republicans to abandon hawkishness altogether if they see Obama as a hawk. \"After the tragedies of Iraq and Libya, Americans are right to expect more from their country when we go to war,\" Paul said, clearly linking his critique of Obama to an attack on the Bush legacy.\\nUntil this speech, Paul\\'s 2016 foreign policy position hadn\\'t been clear. Now it is. Rand \"clearly wants a more restrained US foreign policy,\" says Dan McCarthy, the editor of The American Conservative magazine. According to McCarthy, who\\'s talked about these issues with Paul\\'s staff, Paul has been engaged in a \"trial and error\" experiment. The idea is to figure out how to make a less aggressive foreign policy politically viable in the Republican Party.\\nAfter this speech, the testing phase appears to be over. According to his advisors, this speech represents the final, overarching framework for Paul\\'s worldview. Rand has developed a strategy for wrenching conservatives away from the Bush legacy, and it\\'s now a question of implementing it.\\nThe stakes in the Paul-GOP fight are tectonic\\nShaaaaaaaade. (Brendan Hoffman/Getty Images)\\nPaul is setting the terms of the 2016 election. So far, every plausible Republican nominee who\\'s spoken about foreign policy has taken a more hawkish tack. Paul has picked a fight on foreign policy, and now he\\'s going to get one.\\nThe Republican primary, then, will be at least partly a referendum on the future of Republican foreign policy. If Paul wins the primary \\xe2\\x80\\x94 let alone the presidency \\xe2\\x80\\x94 then the GOP and its elected officials will have to line up behind him. That will mean defending his foreign policy against Democrats, who will likely blast Paul from an interventionist point of view.\\n\"Paul\\'s been clear about his goal,\" DNC Press Secretary Michael Czin told reporters before the speech. \"He wants to see America retreat from our responsibilities around the world.\" A Paul primary win would force Republicans around the country to line up behind Paul\\'s non-interventionism against these attacks. It might also lead the Democratic Party to become more hawkish as it unites against Paul\\'s philosophies \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and that\\'s particularly true if Hillary Clinton, who is already on the more hawkish side of the Democratic spectrum, is the nominee.\\n\"Rand is the first guy,\" McCarthy says, \"to have a chance to come in and do something different than what our foreign policy has been doing in 70 or more years.\" He\\'s not wrong.\\nRelated: Zack Beauchamp explains 3 big reasons why there is less war today.' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'Rand Paul\\'s foreign policy grew up. In a major speech in New York last week, Paul laid out a case for conservative realism. \"We need a foreign policy that recognizes our limits and preserves our might, a common-sense conservative realism of strength and action. We can\\'t retreat from the world, but we can\\'t remake it in our own image either,\" he said.\\nZack Beauchamp at Vox called it one of the most important foreign policy speeches in decades, saying that if Paul runs in 2016 \"he isn\\'t going to move toward the Republican foreign policy consensus; he\\'s going to run at it, with a battering ram.\"\\nPaul\\'s vision of \"limits\" is a far cry from George W. Bush\\'s second inaugural, where the president declaimed, \"By our efforts, we have lit a fire as well \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a fire in the minds of men. It warms those who feel its power, it burns those who fight its progress, and one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world.\"\\nBut Rand\\'s speech is also a step away from his father\\'s ideals. After this speech, it\\'s easy to imagine Ron and Rand debating each other on foreign policy. Rand says that we ought to bomb ISIS but not arm Syrian rebels. His father would reply that bombing ISIS would invite another 9/11 in response. When it comes to Iran and its nuclear ambitions, Rand says let\\'s negotiate. Ron would say nuclear arms are Iran\\'s business not ours, and let\\'s investigate the CIA for its role in Iran in the 1970s.\\nUltimately, the senior Paul did not have a foreign policy. Instead, he had a series of protests against the federal government. They were often richly deserved, but rarely did they constitute a genuine alternative to the status quo.\\nRand could have gone in this direction. And he has shown that he\\'s willing to take a protest to great lengths. Recall his popular filibuster against the use of drones in the United States, into which he folded criticisms of the Patriot Act and the presidential \"kill list\" that includes American citizens. But the younger Paul has decided that if he wants to be president, he better have a substantive foreign policy.\\nFrom both a political and policy perspective, it\\'s interesting that Paul in his speech leaned into criticism of the intervention in Libya. It is a conflict that many people have forgotten about, and one that has resulted in little cost to the United States. Paul criticized the baleful result: a country plunged into even more violence and chaos, where its own government cannot even meet in the capital city. But Paul also went on to say that the war was illegal under the Constitution, as it received no authorization from Congress. Focusing on Libya may have a political purpose, too, as it was an intervention spearheaded by Hillary Clinton, and for which she took enormous credit when the results looked good.\\nPaul\\'s step toward realism is also necessary considering the foreign policy dynamics within his own party. There are three intellectual camps in the Republican foreign policy tent: the neoconservatives, realists, and the various anti-interventionists. Since the end of the Cold War, realists have tended to defer to neoconservative and liberal hawks at the beginning of an intervention, then gravely furrow their brows later; think Condoleezza Rice, Chuck Hagel, or Jon Huntsman. By leading anti-interventionists toward realism, Paul is creating conditions within his own party, and within the world of policy expertise, for an American foreign policy that really does look different than the post-Cold War consensus.\\nAlong the way, Paul\\'s made some odd compromises. His speech was probably too hawkish on Russia, and too bullish on the power of sanctions. (What exactly did sanctions achieve in Cuba, Iraq, or in Moscow short of expressing hostility short of war?) But if Hillary Clinton does decide to run, Paul has probably found the sweet spot for advocating the foreign policy of restraint he believes in, while satisfying a partisan desire for contrast. This is good news for anyone interested in not repeating the disasters America has experienced in Iraq or Libya.' target:0\n",

      "features:b'Employers who stiff their workers or discriminate against them just got a big lift from the Supreme Court, which issued a major ruling Monday making it easier for companies to avoid employee lawsuits.\\nThe 5-4 ruling upheld employers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 use of class-action waivers in arbitration agreements. By signing these controversial provisions, workers give up their right to band together and sue in court for back pay or damages, and are instead forced to take their disputes to arbitrators individually.\\nArbitration agreements have become a common way for employers to stifle lawsuits that could lead to large plaintiff classes and big payouts. Workers backed by employee groups and labor unions challenged their employers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 use of these agreements, claiming they ran afoul of the National Labor Relations Act, or NLRA, which guarantees workers the right to join forces in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmutual aid and protection.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe employer-friendly conservative majority on the court decided against the workers. They ruled that collective bargaining law does not supersede federal law that established the arbitration process, therefore making the class-action waivers in employment contracts legitimate.\\nJustice Neil Gorsuch wrote the opinion for the conservative majority, saying Congress did not write the NLRA to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdisplace\\xe2\\x80\\x9d federal arbitration law.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe policy may be debatable but the law is clear: Congress has instructed that arbitration agreements like those before us must be enforced as written,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Gorsuch wrote.\\nThe high court has previously ruled that companies can force consumers into arbitration agreements with class-action waivers, which are tucked into the fine print when you buy a plane ticket or sign up for a cell phone. The latest ruling effectively sanctions the use of these waivers in the workplace, a practice that has grown increasingly common over the last two decades.\\nThe Supreme Court ruling will have long-lasting implications for workers. Class-action lawsuits are often the most powerful way for employees to secure back pay when their minimum wage or overtime rights have been violated or to secure damages when their bosses run afoul of discrimination laws.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s harder to pursue these cases as a single worker than as part of a group, which is why employers prefer arbitration. Lawyers can be reluctant to file individual complaints in which the judgments or settlements will be small and not worth their time. Many workers are also hesitant to file their lawsuits as individuals, fearing their employers will ostracize or retaliate against them.\\nIn a strong dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called the decision of the majority \\xe2\\x80\\x9cegregiously wrong.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She argued that the rights under the NLRA include the right to pursue litigation collectively, and that an employer-dictated waiver would violate it.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEmployees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 rights to band together to meet their employers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 superior strength would be worth precious little if employers could condition employment on workers signing away those rights,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ginsburg wrote.\\nDuring oral arguments last year, Justice Stephen Breyer said the case could undermine \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe entire heart of the New Deal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by weakening collective action by workers.\\nAccording to a report last year from the Economic Policy Institute, an estimated 25 million workers \\xe2\\x80\\x95 just under one-quarter of non-union employees in the private sector \\xe2\\x80\\x95 give up their right to join class-action lawsuits as a condition of employment. The report anticipated that waivers would become an \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceven more widespread practice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the event the Supreme Court sanctioned them.\\nThe Supreme Court case, National Labor Relations Board v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc., consolidated three separate cases involving different employers: the software company Epic Systems, the accounting and consulting firm Ernst & Young, and the oil company and gas station chain Murphy Oil.\\nA former Murphy Oil employee, Sheila Hobson, claimed that when she worked at one of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s retail stores, she and her colleagues were required to do off-the-clock work they weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t compensated for. They got together to sue the company for back pay. But when they consulted a lawyer, they learned they couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take Murphy Oil to court as a group because they had already agreed to arbitration when they accepted their jobs.\\nThe National Labor Relations Board, the independent agency that enforces collective bargaining law, argued that the forced arbitration clause interfered with Hobson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right to join together with other employees to improve their working conditions. The Obama White House agreed, filing a brief with the Supreme Court in support of Hobson.\\nBut that was under former President Barack Obama. After President Donald Trump was inaugurated, his administration took the extremely rare step of reversing a previous administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position on a sitting case before the court. Last June, Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s acting solicitor general filed a new brief in support of the employers in the case.' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'California voters approved Prop. 8, which bans gay marriage, in 2008. Between then and today, when the US Supreme Court takes up Prop. 8\\'s constitutionality, the social landscape has changed.\\nWhen the United States Supreme Court hears arguments Tuesday morning about Proposition 8, the California ballot initiative that banned gay marriage in the state, legal experts will analyze every comment and gesture to learn what the justices think of the law. In California, by contrast, what residents think of the law is hardly mystery.\\nLittle more than four years after Californians approved the ban, their attitudes toward gay marriage have shifted dramatically. In 2008, the inititiave passed with 52 percent of the vote. Today, some 61 percent of California voters approve of allowing same-sex couples to marry \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with only 32 percent opposed.\\nIn many ways, the forces reshaping Californians\\xe2\\x80\\x99 opinions of gay marriage are the same as those that have driven similar shifts in states nationwide. As homosexuality becomes more accepted and open, more people report having gay friends or family, which has removed many former objections.\\nBut activists say Prop. 8 itself created a backlash that only accelerated Californians\\xe2\\x80\\x99 willingness to take a fresh look at gay rights. And Hollywood, California\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most famous industry, has taken a leading role in breaking down stereotypes and fears.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are all simply more comfortable with gays in our midst,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Barbara O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Connor, director emeritus of the Institute for Study of Politics and Media at California State University, Sacramento. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEveryone has a gay friend or their children do, and so this fear that they are just awful has been allayed. And therein lies the change.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nResearch from Williams Institute states that there are approximately 581,300 same-sex couples in the United States, including 50,000 to 80,000 legally married same-sex spouses and another 85,000 who are in civil unions or registered domestic partnerships. Approximately 20 percent of same-sex couples are raising nearly 250,000 children.\\nWith that broader context, California has felt the issue acutely, in large part because of the controversy surrounding Prop. 8.\\nJane Wishon, who has been married to her husband for 37 years and who has three kids, says her own experience points to California\\xe2\\x80\\x99s broader post-Prop. 8 transformation. An elder in the Presbyterian church, she says she grew up with the solid conviction that marriage was simply between a man and a woman. Her husband suggested to her that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cseparate but equal is never really equal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but while she had no animus toward gays, she felt unbudgeable on the issue: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLike red is just red.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThen she stood near the signature gatherers for Prop. 8. She was only trying to help \\xe2\\x80\\x93 explaining to people the complicated fact that a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for Prop. 8 meant \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to gay marriage and that a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno\\xe2\\x80\\x9d meant \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to gay marriage. But some people had thought she was a gay-rights activist.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey just treated me differently,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she says. Many kept a conspicuous distance.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI realized what LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender] people put up with day after day, and that cemented my support for equality,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she says.\\nLater, getting involved with a marriage-equality group, she met many gays who wanted to get married.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI realized here was a whole group of people who simply loved others and wanted to spend their lives together but were never shown the respect and dignity that comes with marriage,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she says.\\nShe doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to tell others what to think, but suggests that the American government is not living up to its promise of \\xe2\\x80\\x9call men are created equal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIronically, Prop. 8 helped the gay-rights cause in California, activists say.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cProp. 8 really activated the gay community in the state,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Michael McKeon of Love, Honor, Cherish, a group that formed in Los Angeles to fight for marriage equality in 2008.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNobody really thought it would pass, but when it did, I realized I had to do something, and get involved,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he says.\\nDozens of teams began a focused, door-knocking campaign, with he and his partner of 15 years spending many hours talking to people and explaining the issues. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe introduced ourselves, talked about who we were and why the stakes were so important,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe had thousands of conversations ... and we changed people\\'s minds.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAt the same time, gay rights has become more mainstream, with President Obama last year becoming the first president to announce his support for gay marriage while in office.\\nHigh-profile California companies such as Google, Apple, and Facebook are among nearly 300 companies that filed a brief in support of the challenge to the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which allows only heterosexual couples to be eligible for federal marriage benefits.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCompanies should care about repealing DOMA because DOMA forces companies to live in the past,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Joe Solmenese, co-founder at the law firm Gavin/Solmonese.\\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.\\nHollywood has also played a role in reflecting this shift in attitudes, says Robert Thompson, founder of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University in New York. While Ellen DeGeneres\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming out on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEllen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was seen as a watershed moment for gays on television, more recent portrayals \\xe2\\x80\\x93 such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWill and Grace\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cModern Family\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 have knit gay characters more seamlessly into everyday American life.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPop culture is not so good at pushing the envelope as it is in licking it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Mr. Thompson.

      "features:b'WASHINGTON \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Again and again, Senate Republicans made one thing clear Wednesday: They would not vote to confirm Eric H. Holder Jr. as attorney general. They were less passionate, however, about the person they were considering to replace him, Loretta E. Lynch.\\nMs. Lynch had steeled herself for tough questioning from a new Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee, particularly on her views of President Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s immigration policy. But the questioning was mostly cordial, and, most important, the Republicans on the committee who hold the key to Ms. Lynch\\xe2\\x80\\x99s confirmation \\xe2\\x80\\x94 she needs two of their votes to proceed to a vote by the full Senate \\xe2\\x80\\x94 showed little opposition.\\nInstead, their sharpest criticism during several hours of questioning was reserved for Mr. Holder, who is resigning as attorney general after six years in which he frequently clashed with Republican lawmakers who accused him of politicizing the Justice Department. The focus on Mr. Holder, an outspoken liberal voice in the administration who has referred to himself as the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwingman,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d allowed Ms. Lynch to parry the most contentious questions and present herself as an independent alternative.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not Eric Holder, are you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Senator John Cornyn of Texas, a Republican who allies of Ms. Lynch believe could be persuaded to vote for her confirmation.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she replied.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo one is suggesting that you are, but of course, Attorney General Holder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s record is heavy on our minds now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Cornyn responded.\\nOn the issue of immigration, Ms. Lynch said she found it \\xe2\\x80\\x9creasonable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that the Justice Department had concluded it was lawful for Mr. Obama to unilaterally ease the threat of deportation for millions of unauthorized immigrants. Mr. Holder similarly endorsed that view.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly, I was not involved in the decision,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Lynch said, a theme she revisited when asked about Mr. Holder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision not to defend a federal ban on same-sex marriage, about a report on state secrets and about a program to target banks that do business with questionable companies.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve asked how I will be different from Eric Holder,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Lynch told Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will be Loretta Lynch.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThat could be enough to win her confirmation. Senators raised few questions about Ms. Lynch\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own record. She has spent nearly all of her career as a federal prosecutor, which has created a long record of casework but few political decisions to scrutinize. She began in government as a young lawyer at the United States attorney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office in Brooklyn and worked her way into senior management. She has twice been confirmed by the Senate to serve as the United States attorney there.\\nThe Judiciary Committee contains some of the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most strident critics, including Mr. Cruz and Senators Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Mike Lee of Utah and David Vitter of Louisiana, all of whom have expressed outrage over the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s immigration policy and his exercise of executive power in general. Mr. Vitter has already said he will not vote to confirm Ms. Lynch, and Mr. Sessions called her approval of the immigration policy \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery troubling.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re here defending this, and I believe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s indefensible,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Sessions said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI just want to tell you, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a big problem for me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThere were few such exchanges, however. And Ms. Lynch, who has a reputation as difficult to rattle, never appeared flustered, even as the hearing stretched into the night.\\nDemocrats see some Republicans, such as Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and Jeff Flake of Arizona, as possible confirmation votes. Mr. Flake said he had made no decision on Ms. Lynch but had come away with a favorable impression and expected that she would be confirmed.\\nMr. Graham said he wanted to hear more from Ms. Lynch about her views on the use of drones and military detention on American citizens. But he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrom my point of view, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve acquitted yourself very well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMr. Hatch said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m impressed with your qualifications, and I hope I can support your nomination.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He told Ms. Lynch that, if she remained independent of the White House, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be a great attorney general.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nOn matters of policy, Ms. Lynch called capital punishment \\xe2\\x80\\x9can effective penalty\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and said she disagreed with Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statements that marijuana was no more harmful than alcohol. She called the National Security Agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s collection of American phone records \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccertainly constitutional, and effective.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSenator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat on the panel, said she had given \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca flawless performance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, called her testimony \\xe2\\x80\\x9camong the most accomplished and impressive that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen as a member of this committee.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIf confirmed, Ms. Lynch would be the first female African-American attorney general. One issue that received little attention in the hearing was the tension between law enforcement and minority communities after the deaths of African-American men at the hands of police officers in Ferguson, Mo., and Staten Island. Over the years, she has spoken passionately about the need for minorities to feel safe in their communities, while remaining a strong supporter of the police.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat I have found most effective is getting people together and simply listening to their concerns, being open, helping them see that, in fact, we are all in this together,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said Wednesday.\\nMr. Holder angered some law enforcement groups with comments that they saw as supporting protesters against the police after the Ferguson shooting.\\nMr. Holder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tenure made him a hero for many liberal groups as the Justice Department increased prosecutions of civil rights violations, embraced same-sex marriage, scaled back the war on drugs and reduced the prison population for the first time in a generation.\\nHis appearances on Capitol Hill, however, were frequently heated. The Republican-controlled House held him in contempt over what critics said was a refusal to cooperate fully in an investigation into the botched gunrunning investigation known as Operation Fast and Furious.\\nGoing into Wednesday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hearings, Democrats sought to distance Ms. Lynch from Mr. Holder.\\nEric Schultz, the White House deputy press secretary, said the president was proud of Mr. Holder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tenure.\\nAs for Ms. Lynch\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remarks, Mr. Schultz said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe might have been just being literal, that she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not Eric Holder.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d' target:-1\n",

      "features:b'A frantic and impatient White House is pressuring House GOP leaders for another showdown vote on repealing Obamacare next week so it can notch a legislative win before President Donald Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first 100 days in office.\\nBut while the outlines of a possible deal are starting to come together, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s far from clear that House Republican leaders have found the sweet spot to pass their embattled alternative health plan.\\nStory Continued Below\\nThe White House does not schedule House floor votes. And while some senior administration officials suggested Thursday that a vote will occur next week, multiple House GOP sources told POLITICO that is unlikely.\\nIndeed, the vote is not currently on the calendar. Nor do Republican insiders think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s even possible, as Congress will reconvene Tuesday after a two-week Easter recess. That would leave them with one day to whip votes \\xe2\\x80\\x94 an unlikely time frame for such a heavy legislative lift.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe question is whether it can get 216 votes in the House, and the answer isn\\'t clear at this time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a senior GOP aide said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is no legislative text and therefore no agreement to do a whip count on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe conflicting narratives suggest top administration officials and House Republican leaders are either miscommunicating \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or, more likely, that White House sources are squeezing Speaker Paul Ryan and his team, telling them to move quickly. Notably, the same senior White House officials who suggested a vote would occur next week also said the text of a new deal will likely be circulated Friday \"or by the weekend.\"\\nThe claim perplexed some GOP insiders who don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect legislative text for a few days, at the earliest.\\nThe back-and-forth highlights just how impatient Trump is growing with Congress. Administration officials are feeling inordinate pressure to advance the legislation out of the House, fearing that failure to repeal the health care law will dominate coverage of the administration\\'s first 100 days, which end next week, officials say.\\nTrump on Thursday predicted that health care legislation would pass \"next week or shortly thereafter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d During a joint news conference alongside Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, the president also took issue with the characterization that Republicans gave up on health care after they pulled the original House bill. He reminded reporters that Obamacare was roughly a year-and-half-long effort, while he said he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only had about two months to negotiate a better deal.\\nBut multiple House GOP insiders say the White House doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand how Congress works, and just because Trump officials say there will be a vote next week doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make it so. GOP leaders cannot whip votes until legislative text is actually written, and it will be tough to get a good sense of where the conference stands until members return to town on Tuesday.\\nGOP leaders have their work cut out for them in the meantime. While the White House believes it is \"close\" to having the 216 votes needed to get a bill out of the House, one senior official said, others on Capitol Hill aren\\'t nearly as confident.\\nInsiders say the deal could probably deliver between 15 to 20 conservative House Freedom Caucus members who were previously \"no\" votes, so long as the text says exactly what was agreed to. But moderates \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and more than a few traditional Republicans \\xe2\\x80\\x94 say the deal is bad policy.\\nIndeed, several centrist sources were incensed that Tuesday Group co-chair Tom MacArthur, the top negotiator for the moderates, agreed to the changes without getting the backing of his group. They\\'re not sure he can deliver the votes.\\n\"The amendment doesn\\'t address the things that I had concerns about \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the things I think are detrimental to the people I represent,\" said Rep. Dan Donovan, a centrist New York Republican who is currently a \"no\" on the bill.\\nDonovan said there has been little to no Tuesday Group coordination on the negotiations, and he was skeptical that the deal would move any moderate votes.\\nThe White House began ramping up pressure on GOP leaders two weeks ago, when top Trump officials called Ryan to the White House and chided the Wisconsin Republican for not delaying recess until a deal was struck.\\nSince then, the White House has worked with Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and MacArthur (R-N.J.) to come up with a deal they hope will pick off enough conservatives and moderate support to pass the House.\\nTrump, meanwhile, has asked repeatedly \\xe2\\x80\\x94 sometimes several times a day \\xe2\\x80\\x94 about the status of the health care law and seems more engaged than during last month\\'s failed effort to get Ryan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s American Health Care Act through the chamber, a senior administration official said. The president believes that it will be difficult to gain momentum on other issues without \"getting something done on health care,\" according to one person who spoke with him. OMB Director Mick Mulvaney separately said Thursday the White House is ready to negotiate with Democrats on adding key Obamacare insurance cost-sharing subsidies to a fiscal 2017 spending bill to keep the government running -- if Democrats agree to pay for some of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s priorities,such as defense and border security money.\\nAccording to a draft of the tentative deal obtained by POLITICO, the latest proposal would allow states to apply for \"limited waivers\" that would undermine Obamacare\\'s protections for pre-existing conditions. Under these waivers, states could opt out of Obamacare standards setting minimum benefits that health plans must offer and a requirement \\xe2\\x80\\x94 called community rating \\xe2\\x80\\x94 forbidding insurers from charging different prices to people based on health status.\\nBoth are provisions that the GOP\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ultraconservatives have pushed to eliminate as part of the repeal effort, contending that these coverage mandates drive up the cost of insurance. States opting out of the community rating rules would be forced to set up an \"invisible risk-sharing\" program aimed at providing a backstop to health plans while preventing sicker patients from being priced out of the market. The hope is that protecting insurers from the most expensive customers will bring down the costs for the rest of the risk pool. That will allow insurers to lower premiums, which in turn will entice more customers into the individual market.\\nAt the same time, the deal would allow states the option of maintaining insurance protections, supported by centrist Republicans, including community rating.\\nWhile the changes will likely win over some conservatives, leaders will have a problem with their centrists. MacArthur said in a statement Thursday that he has insisted during the discussions that any compromise have protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions. But many of his like-minded colleagues believe he did not keep that promise under the current agreement.\\nMany centrists don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t approve of MacArthur\\xe2\\x80\\x99s negotiating tactics. While Meadows has made a point of ensuring that any potential changes he negotiates will likely get a green light from his members, some Tuesday Group members do not feel MacArthur has done the same.\\nModerates and a few traditional Republicans believe the legislative changes will hurt people with pre-existing conditions, a population they vowed to protect on the campaign trail. But since GOP leaders are feeling the heat from the White House, they may have to put the changes on the floor regardless.\\nHouse Republicans will likely discuss the latest changes during a Saturday telephone conference call. The call, however, is routine during recess and was actually announced last week \\xe2\\x80\\x94 well before the White House, MacArthur and Meadows publicized the new accord.\\nThe renewed effort also comes just days before the high-stakes deadline over funding the government or shutting it down over contentious issues \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including whether Republicans will fund a key Obamacare subsidy program, financing for Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s border wall and boosting military spending, among others.\\nTrump and some administration officials have threatened to cut off Obamacare cost-sharing subsidies \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a decision that would wreak havoc on the Obamacare insurance exchanges \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in a bid to get Democrats to negotiate on a replacement plan.\\nThose subsidies, which are at the center of a court battle begun under the Obama administration, help lower-income people pay medical bills and insurance deductibles. Taking them away would prompt insurers to either flee the market or severely hike premiums to cover those costs. Despite calls from the health care industry, business groups and Democrats to continue the payments, the White House has yet to tip its hand.\\nPaul Demko, Adam Cancryn and Nolan D.

      "features:b'New Jersey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s highest court ruled on Tuesday that Gov. Chris Christie could skip the pension payments he promised to make in the signature law of his tenure, averting a huge fiscal crisis just weeks before the state closes its books for the year.\\nWhile the 5-to-2 decision by the Supreme Court of New Jersey handed Mr. Christie a victory, it also underscored how much his fortunes have changed as he takes steps to run for president.\\nMr. Christie rose to stardom in the national Republican Party largely on the overhaul of public employee pensions that he signed in 2011. He used the law as evidence that he could reach across the aisle to take on tough problems \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not to mention powerful unions. He boasted in his keynote speech to the Republican National Convention in 2012 that he had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfixed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the problem of underfunded pensions, one shared by many states.\\nBut as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJersey Comeback\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the governor promoted has failed to materialize \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the state economy has lagged behind his forecasts, and behind neighboring states and the nation \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Mr. Christie said the state could not afford to make the payments he had promised in the law. That has left New Jersey with one of the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest pension liabilities, and a record nine credit downgrades from Wall Street ratings agencies.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe loss of public trust due to the broken promises\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the law, the court wrote in its decision Tuesday, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis staggering.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe court said that the governor and the Legislature violated the debt limitation clause in the State Constitution when they signed the law requiring the state to make large payments over a series of years.\\nBut the court did not so much agree with Mr. Christie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s budget policies as it did express a reluctance to wade into the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunseemly\\xe2\\x80\\x9d business of deciding which programs to fund.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat the state must get its financial house in order is plain,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Justice Jaynee LaVecchia, who was appointed in 2000 by the Republican governor Christine Todd Whitman, wrote in the opinion. Still, the decision added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe responsibility for the budget process remains squarely where the framers placed it: on the Legislature and executive, accountable to the voters through the electoral process. Ultimately, it is the people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s responsibility to hold the elective branches of government responsible for their judgment and for their exercise of constitutional powers. This is not an occasion for us to act on the other branches\\xe2\\x80\\x99 behalf.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe 2011 law and a companion signed in 2010 required public employees to pay more toward their benefits, and in exchange, the state agreed to make the annual pension payments that several governors had ignored.\\nMr. Christie made the payments for two years, but cut them back beginning with his budget for 2014, saying he could not balance the budget if he made them. The payment in 2014 was $696 million instead of the $1.58 billion the law required; the 2015 payment was $681 million instead of the $2.25 billion owed.\\nThe unions sued, and a trial court ruled in February that the law had given public employees a constitutionally protected right to those payments. The Supreme Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision reversed that.\\nUnions called the ruling \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdevastating\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindefensible,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d saying it was unfair that they had held up their end of the deal, while the Supreme Court allowed the governor to abandon his.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe only beneficiary of this ruling is Gov. Christie, who can continue to deceive New Jersey residents into believing that his budgets have been balanced,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the president of the New Jersey Education Association, Wendell Steinhauer, said in a statement.\\nIn a dissent, Justice Barry T. Albin, who was appointed by a Democratic governor, said that under the logic of the majority opinion, the entire law should be invalidated.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe decision unfairly requires public workers to uphold their end of the law\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bargain \\xe2\\x80\\x94 increased weekly deductions from their paychecks to fund their future pensions \\xe2\\x80\\x94 while allowing the state to slip from its binding commitment to make commensurate contributions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Justice Albin wrote. Chief Justice Stuart Rabner, who was appointed by a Democratic governor but reappointed last year by Mr. Christie, joined that dissent.\\nThe Senate president, Stephen M. Sweeney, a Democrat who lost support among unions by working with the governor to sign the overhaul, said he was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeeply disappointed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe continued refusal by the administration to meet the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financial obligations does not make the problem go away,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt only pushes it down the road and allows it to grow worse and cost more. Each dollar in deferred payment will cost three dollars in the future. The governor is exacerbating the problem.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nDemocrats vowed that they would send Mr. Christie a budget that makes the required pension payment in the next fiscal year, which begins in July.\\nBut the governor is almost certain to strike the payment with his line-item veto. In recent months he has said that the 2011 law was only one step toward fixing the pension problem, and has called on unions to give up more benefits.\\nIn a statement after the ruling, Mr. Christie urged unions to return to the table \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto finally solve this problem once and for all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut unions and Democrats who lent him crucial support in 2011 said Mr. Christie had to guarantee that the state would finally make its payments.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe real issue here is trust,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Sweeney said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow can we ask workers to come to the table when the governor will not honor his commitments?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d' target:-1\n",

They supported them,\" said Putin, accusing unnamed people or groups of providing Russia\\'s foes with political, financial and \"media\" support.\\nReport: Carjacked man describes wild ordeal\\nBased on investigative leads and information provided by Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, investigators believe that each of the brothers had their own remote control device to detonate bombs near the marathon\\'s finish line, said a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation on Friday.\\nThe previous day, a law enforcement official said at least one of the bombs that exploded was set off by remote control.\\nTragedy in Boston: How to help\\nThree days after that attack, and hours after authorities released images of two suspects, they \"spontaneously\" decided to go to New York\\'s Times Square to blow up their six remaining explosives, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told investigators.\\nBut a botched carjacking spoiled the impromptu road trip, said Tsarnaev, whose account was outlined Thursday by New York\\'s police commissioner.\\n\"We don\\'t know that we would have been able to stop the terrorists had they arrived here from Boston,\" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. \"We\\'re just thankful that we didn\\'t have to find out that answer.\"\\nBefore forcing their way into the vehicle the night of April 18, the brothers shot dead a campus police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, police said.\\nThe hijacked vehicle, a Mercedes SUV, ran low on fuel and they stopped at a service station, where the vehicle\\'s owner escaped. Shortly thereafter, police picked up the trail of the SUV. A pursuit followed, during which, authorities say, the men were throwing the bombs out the vehicle\\'s window at them. The gun battle and Tamerlan Tsarnaev\\'s death followed.\\nIn a Boston Globe story, the man who was carjacked -- a 26-year-old Chinese entrepreneur identified only as Danny -- described his 90-minute ordeal, from when a man brandishing a silver handgun got into his Mercedes to when he ran for his life into a Mobil gas station\\'s supply room.\\nDuring this time, Danny told the Globe, the gun-wielding man confessed to pulling off the Boston bombing and to killing a police officer in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where MIT\\'s campus is located.\\nTogether they crisscrossed around the Boston area, at one point stopping for gas and another time so that another person could join them in the car. Danny recognized both men from the photos released by the FBI earlier on April 18, men who authorities now say were Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.\\nThe carjackers openly discussed traveling to New York, before Danny was able to run to safety.\\n\"He fell down, screaming, \\'Please, please call ... the police. They want to kill me. They have a gun, they have a bomb,\\'\\'\" Tarek Ahmed, the clerk working in the gas station at the time, told CNN\\'s Piers Morgan.\\nDanny first hid at the front counter, then went to a storage room. Ahmed, after first making sure this man wasn\\'t one of the bombing suspects and separately thinking he might be drunk, quickly picked up a phone and called 911.\\n\"I was waiting (for) someone to shoot me at this moment,\" Ahmed said, adding he couldn\\'t see outside from where he called. \"I was waiting to die ... I wanted to finish my call very fast with the police.\"\\nWithin five minutes, the gas station was teeming with police. And a short time later, after a chase in which the suspects allegedly shot at police and threw bombs out their windows, Tamerlan Tsarnaev was dead. His brother was captured about 20 hours later.\\nJames Alan Fox -- a criminology professor at Northeastern University, where Danny had been a student, and who has spent considerable time with him over recent days -- told CNN that the carjacking victim \"doesn\\'t like to see himself as a hero.\"\\n\"After all, he says, \\'I was only trying to save myself,\\'\" Fox said. \"But ... his actions, his composure, his smarts were what led this case to a close and may have indeed saved thousands of Americans if we believe, in fact, that (the Boston suspects) had plans to do more bombings in New York City.\"\\nSuspect\\'s widow is assisting investigation, lawyer says' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'WASHINGTON -- Senate leaders announced Tuesday that they\\'ve resolved a weeks-long standoff over a sex trafficking bill containing controversial anti-abortion language, clearing the way, at last, for U.S. attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch to get her confirmation vote.\\nLynch has been waiting for more than five months for a confirmation vote. Most recently, Republican leaders tied the vote to passage of the trafficking bill. That bill has nothing to do with Lynch, but as long as it wasn\\'t moving, neither was Lynch\\'s confirmation.\\nAides to Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas) have been working for weeks to break the impasse. As introduced, the bill would have collected fees from sex traffickers and put them into a new victims fund that would be subject to the Hyde Amendment, the federal provision that bars the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape and incest. Democrats objected to the abortion language in general, but more so because the bill expanded the Hyde Amendment to include private funds.\\nUnder the deal announced Tuesday, the bill will create two funding streams. The first one flows from fines collected from sex traffickers, and would be used for survivor services excluding health care. This stream would not include Hyde Amendment restrictions. The second one would come from community health center funds that are already subject to the abortion limits.\\nThe deal lets both parties walk away with a solid talking point: Democrats can celebrate that they prevented an expansion of Hyde, while Republicans can say they didn\\'t cave on restricting abortion funds.\\n\"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m pleased that we were able to reach a deal that gets this done in a way that does not expand restrictions on women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s health to non-taxpayer dollars or to new programs, and provides survivors with real dedicated funds for the support and services they need,\" Murray said on the Senate floor.\\n\"No compromise is perfect,\" she added. \"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure Senator Cornyn would say the same thing.\"\\nCornyn said he was \"thrilled\" that they\\'ve reached a deal on the bill, which has broad bipartisan support.\\nA spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he expects the Senate to pass the sex trafficking bill on Wednesday. From there, the Senate will move to Lynch\\'s confirmation vote.\\nMcConnell said the attorney general nominee should get a vote \"in the next day or so.\"\\nLast week, President Barack Obama fumed that Republicans have made Lynch wait for so long, saying the delay is just \"embarrassing.\"\\nCORRECTION: This story previously misstated the nature of the survivor services that would benefit from the funding collected from sex trafficking fines under the legislation.

He said they asked Harney County Sheriff Dave Ward and federal agencies to put an end to what he called \"abuses\" against local ranchers Dwight and Steven Hammond.\\nThe Hammonds were convicted of arson three years ago for fires that burned on federal land in 2001 and 2006. Though they served their original sentences for the conviction -- Dwight serving three months, Steven serving one year -- an appellate judge ruled in October that the terms were too short under federal minimum sentencing laws.\\nRyan Bundy talks on the phone at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge near Burns, Ore., Sunday, Jan. 3, 2016.

The protesters took over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge south of Burns on Saturday after participating in a peaceful rally.\\nSheriff Ward said the protesters were no patriots. \"These men came to Harney County claiming to be part of militia groups supporting local ranchers, when in reality these men had alternative motives to attempt to overthrow the county and federal government in hopes to spark a movement across the United States,\" Ward said in a statement. \"We are currently working jointly with several organizations to make sure the citizens of Harney County are safe and this issue is resolved as quickly and peaceful as possible.\"\\nBuildings at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge are seen near Burns, Ore., Sunday, Jan. 3, 2016.

Still, the bureau did not give any specifics about its response in a statement Sunday, citing \"safety considerations for both those inside the refuge as well as the law enforcement officers involved.\"\\nAmmon Bundy&aposs brother, Ryan, said they planned on staying at the refuge as long as it takes.

However, prosecutors said the fires were set to cover up poaching.\\nThe decision generated controversy and is part of a decades-long dispute between some Westerners and the federal government over the use of public lands. The issue traces back to the 1970s and the \"Sagebrush Rebellion,\" a move by Western states like Nevada to increase local control over federal land. Critics of the push for more local control have said the federal government should administer the public lands for the widest possible uses, including environmental and recreation.\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.' target:1\n",
      "features:b'On Monday, Mitt Romney delivered what his campaign billed as a major foreign policy address, in which he sought to distinguish himself from the man he called the \"lead from behind\" president.\\nThe speech at the Virginia Military Institute, which largely focused on the Middle East, served as something of a warm-up for the two remaining debates between Romney and Obama to be held later this month, one of which will focus entirely on foreign policy, while the other will deal with both domestic and national security issues.\\nIn the forthcoming debates Romney will have the tricky job of trying to position himself as tougher on national security than Obama \\\\-- who tripled the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan during his presidency and ordered the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.\\nObama has also authorized six times as many drone attacks as George W. Bush did in Pakistan against suspected members of al Qaeda and the Taliban. The attacks during the Obama administration have killed at least 1,400 people, almost double the number of prisoners that were transferred to the Guantanamo Bay prison camp by the Bush administration.\\nObama is also the first American president to authorize the assassination of a U.S. citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki, who played an operational role in al Qaeda\\'s Yemeni affiliate and was killed by a US drone strike in Yemen last year. Indeed, Obama has vastly escalated the American covert war in Yemen, using CIA drones and U.S. Special Operations Forces, such as SEAL Team 6.\\nCriticism of Obama\\'s national security policies is growing on the left about the overall legality of CIA drone strikes and, in particular, the al-Awlaki killing.\\nFact Check: Romney\\'s comparison of past, present Navy pointless\\nGiven those facts, how then do you run to the right of Obama on national security? Well, you might say that you are planning to go to war with Iran because of its advancing nuclear program. Or you might say that you will institute an American no-fly zone over Syria without a United Nations authorization for such a measure. Or that you will keep U.S. combat troops in Afghanistan well past the withdrawal date of 2014 announced by the Obama administration.\\nThe problem with such policy choices is that the American public has little appetite for more wars in the Muslim world. No such policies were mentioned in Romney\\'s speech on Monday, nor will they likely feature in his future debates with the president.\\nOn Monday Romney did say, regarding Syria, that his administration would \"identify and organize those members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain the arms they need to defeat Assad\\'s tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets,\" a policy that is more aggressive than providing \"nonlethal\" help, such as communications equipment, which the Obama administration is already giving to Syrian opposition forces.\\nBut even this supposed distinction from Obama was less than meets the eye, as Romney did not directly say that his administration would arm the Syrian rebels. And close American allies Saudi Arabia and Qatar are already providing weapons to them.\\nIf the U.S. were to start arming the rebels directly, identifying exactly which parts of the Syrian opposition should get arms might be difficult, because the opposition is a tangled mess of many factions that even includes elements of al Qaeda.\\nFact Check: Was Obama \\'silent\\' on Iran 2009 protests?\\nAccording to Leila Hilal, a Middle East expert at the New America Foundation, there are more than 800 militias now operating in Syria, making it a complex task to sort out the ones that are both militarily viable and more aligned with American interests.\\nIn his Monday speech, Romney advanced the sensible idea that the $1.5 billion in yearly American aid to Egypt should be conditioned on its building up its democratic institutions and maintaining its peace treaty with Israel.\\nBut other than this good idea, Romney offered few specific policies to distinguish himself from what the Obama administration is already doing in the greater Middle East.\\nRomney explained that he would prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons capability and would not hesitate to put more sanctions on Iran. But this is basically the position of the Obama administration, which has said it will not allow Iran to have nuclear weapons and has imposed such onerous sanctions on the country that the Iranian currency has plunged in value as much as 80% against the dollar since the beginning of the year.\\nOn Afghanistan, Romney said he will work to transition from U.S. combat troops to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014, which is -- the Obama administration\\'s policy.\\nRomney said he would not make a \"politically timed retreat\" from Afghanistan, a somewhat mystifying construction, since this year Obama negotiated a well-publicized Strategic Partnership Agreement with the Afghan government that will keep an as-yet-unspecified number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan in an advisory and counterterrorism role until 2024. That is something that Romney didn\\'t mention in his Monday speech and hardly suggests a precipitous Obama-led retreat from Afghanistan, which is already America\\'s longest war.\\nFamously, Romney didn\\'t mention that longest war in his acceptance speech at the Republican convention in August, so his new embrace of the Afghan War seems a tad belated.\\nRomney\\'s Monday speech underlined the fact that there is more agreement than disagreement between mainstream Democrats and mainstream Republicans on foreign policy issues.\\nFact Check: Did Obama say he wants \\'daylight\\' between U.S., Israel?\\nTo create the illusion that there are genuine substantive policy differences, Romney enlisted the issue of trade, saying on Monday that he would \"champion free trade. ... The president has not signed one new free trade agreement in the past four years.\"\\nThere have been serious critiques of Obama for not being more active in negotiating new trade deals, but to claim that he hasn\\'t signed any in the past four years is demonstrably false. In fact, the Obama administration signed trade deals with Panama, Colombia and South Korea last year, which a headline on FoxNews.com termed the \"biggest since NAFTA.\"\\nWhen stories on Fox undercut your claims as a Republican contender for president, you have a problem.\\nRomney was also grasping at straws when he said on Monday that \"the size of our Navy is at levels not seen since 1916.\"\\nThat isn\\'t really true even in the trivial, numerical sense \\\\-- but more importantly, the U.S. Navy in 1916 did not consist of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines with enough nuclear weapons to wipe out life on much of the planet.\\nThe United States today has 11 aircraft carriers, while the Chinese have recently built their first one, which won\\'t actually be able to handle aircraft operations for years into the future.\\nAnd the overall idea that the U.S. is falling behind militarily is nonsensical. The U.S. spent more on defense in 2011 than the countries with the next 13 highest defense budgets combined.\\nFact Check: Has Obama \\'not signed one new free-trade agreement\\'?\\nIf Monday\\'s speech is a preview of how Romney will handle the foreign policy debates with Obama, the president will be on much firmer ground than he was with his uncertain performance during the first debate, which focused exclusively on domestic issues.\\nFollow @CNNOpinion on Twitter.\\nJoin us at Facebook/CNNOpinion.' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'The news that Scotland has rejected independence from the rest of the United Kingdom -- by a relatively close 55-45 margin -- has reassured financial markets and many governments across the world.\\nNot only does it secure the future (for now, at least) of one of the longest and most successful political unions in the world -- it also makes the prospect of a future British exit from the European Union less likely in coming years.\\nNumerous world leaders, from U.S. President Barack Obama to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, had strongly asserted that it is in the best interests of the global community for the UK to stay together. This reflects the fact that, while no longer a great power, Britain continues to play a significant role on the world stage with wide-ranging international interests.\\nHowever, given the significant size of the \"Yes\" vote, uncertainties remain, including the possibility of another Scottish independence referendum in the next decade or two. These unknowns could impact the UK\\'s ability to continue to punch above its weight on the global stage and will leave residual concerns for allies.\\nInternationally, it is the U.S., Europe and other key British allies which paid keenest attention to the vote outcome. This is because UK foreign policy has centered, in the post-war period, around the strategic importance of its alliance with the U.S. and integration with Europe.\\nIn Washington, where Obama indicated his opposition to Scottish independence repeatedly, there was perhaps the most significant apprehension of the outcome of yesterday\\'s vote. Although America will be reassured by the result, some concerns will remain particularly about Britain\\'s military capabilities, including the future of its nuclear arsenal, which is located in Scotland.\\nThis is particularly so in the context of the current 2015-16 UK Strategic Defence and Security Review, which will feature further cuts. Some in Washington (along with other allies) will remain apprehensive about the future of the UK Trident nuclear deterrent which is due for potential renewal in coming years.\\nA further potential complication here is that Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond ran the \"Yes\" campaign on a pledge that Scotland would become a non-nuclear nation within five years under independence. Given the significant support for this proposition, and the fact that most of Britain\\'s Trident submarines are based in Scotland, there may be growing pressure for relocation of these bases in coming years, despite the failure of the pro-independence movement to secure a majority.\\nSuch a move will be a very expensive, protracted process which the Ministry of Defence asserts will cost billions and take at least a decade. It is possible that this, allied with defence budget cutbacks, could significantly influence the British debate over renewal of Trident in coming years. Such uncertainty will prompt added anxiety in Washington and amongst some other UK allies, including NATO.\\nIn Brussels and European capitals, today\\'s decision will be welcomed in many quarters too. Firstly, there is now a stronger likelihood that the United Kingdom will not now leave the EU in any \"in-out\" referendum.\\nThis is because Scots, in general, are more favorable toward continued membership of the EU than the English who account for a majority of the Britain\\'s population. Thus, if Scotland had voted for independence, and didn\\'t take part in any subsequent EU plebiscite, it would have been more likely that -- in a close vote -- that Britain could have left the EU.\\nSecondly, the outcome will please leaders in those European countries where other significant separatist movements exist. Spain, for instance, faces pressure for a binding referendum for Catalans in coming months. A Scottish \"Yes\" vote could also have turbo-charged the separatist ambitions of Flemish campaigners in Belgium, the Northern League in Italy, and, to a lesser extent, French separatists.\\nWhile allies across the world will be at least partially reassured, the relatively close vote -- not to mention the significant devolution of powers from London to Edinburgh that now seems likely -- means that the UK is likely to be transformed. Along with the possibility of another Scottish referendum in the next decade or two, this means that the territorial integrity of Britain cannot be taken for granted in the medium to long term.\\nThe continued possibility of the UK\\'s dismemberment may well undermine its generally high international stature in the eyes of many across the world. This is because Britain\\'s international reputation rests, in large part, upon its stability as a unified state, as Barack Obama has pointed out.\\nThese foreign concerns will be exacerbated by the fact that there will now be growing pressure in Wales and Northern Ireland for significant additional devolution. Many foreigners, especially key allies, will therefore wonder if one or both of these areas will also remain in the union too in the long term.\\nTaken overall, today\\'s vote will provide reassurance for key UK allies, especially the U.S. and Europe, despite lingering concerns about the future of Britain\\'s military capability. While the UK\\'s territorial integrity is assured in the short term, a second referendum in Scotland cannot be ruled out.\\nREAD MORE: Scotland says \"No\" to independence\\nREAD MORE: What \"No\" vote means for David Cameron\\nREAD MORE: What 5 secessionist movements can learn' target:-1\n",

He issued a new statement Tuesday, saying he regretted speaking to the group.\\n\"Twelve years ago, I spoke to many different Louisiana groups as a state representative, trying to build support for legislation that focused on cutting wasteful state spending, eliminating government corruption, and stopping tax hikes. One of the many groups that I spoke to regarding this critical legislation was a group whose views I wholeheartedly condemn. It was a mistake I regret, and I emphatically oppose the divisive racial and religious views groups like these hold. I am very disappointed that anyone would try to infer otherwise for political gain,\" said Scalise.\\nHe continued, \"As a Catholic, these groups hold views that are vehemently opposed to my own personal faith, and I reject that kind of hateful bigotry.

Another U.S. official told CNN the Department of Defense will be sending experts in chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction.\\nThe discussions are expected to take place in several sessions over two days, but negotiations may not be concluded in Geneva, the officials cautioned.\\nThe officials said a final deal -- whenever it is reached -- would be taken to the United Nations and presented in a Security Council resolution.\\nRussia calls off Security Council session\\nMoscow withdrew its request for an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting on the Syrian crisis that had been set for Tuesday, a U.N. diplomat said.\\nRussia -- which has been a key player in efforts to have Syria give up its chemical weapons -- dropped its request due to \"changing circumstances,\" according to the diplomat.\\nSyria is willing to join the Chemical Weapons Convention, Foreign Minister Walid Moallem said before departing Moscow.\\n\"We are ready to fully cooperate in realizing the initiative,\" he told reporters, according to a CNN translation.\\nEarlier Tuesday, Russia\\'s Foreign Ministry said it deemed as \"unacceptable\" a French proposal -- also backed by some U.S. lawmakers -- asking the Security Council to declare Syria responsible for the August 21 chemical attack that U.S. officials say killed more than 1,400 people.\\nAccording to Syrian state TV, Syria on Tuesday accepted Russia\\'s proposal to put its chemical weapons under international control a day after Kerry floated the idea in what appeared to be an off-the-cuff comment suggesting it would be the only way for Syria to avoid a punishing Western military strike.\\nMoallem said the country was ready to disclose the location of its chemical weapons, halt production and show facilities to representatives of Russia, the United Nations and other states.\\nSyria\\'s chemical arsenal at a glance\\nSyria is a longtime Russian ally, and Russian officials have argued, as have Syrian officials, that rebel forces could have staged the attack.\\nGrowing support\\nMoallem said Tuesday that his country had agreed to the Russian proposal after what the Russian new agency Interfax quoted him as calling \"a very fruitful round of talks\" with his Russian counterpart, Lavrov, on Monday.\\nDespite the lack of details, the idea was gaining traction around the world.\\nOn Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed support for the concept. Tuesday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said it would safeguard stability in the region. Syrian ally Iran welcomed the proposal, and Germany expressed interest.\\nFrench Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said France will not accept delays in the transfer.\\n\"We need quick results,\" Fabius said.\\nEuropean Union Foreign Affairs Secretary Catherine Ashton said she supported the French plan to bring the issue to the Security Council, saying the proposal \"now needs to be fully worked up as quickly as possible.\"\\nEven Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, a proponent of a military strike on Syria and robust aid to the rebels, said the idea was worth exploring.\\n\"I\\'m very, very skeptical,\" he said on CNN\\'s \"New Day.\" \"But the fact is, you can\\'t pass up this opportunity -- if it is one.\"\\nCNN Poll: Syria strike\\nInauspicious beginning\\nThe Russian proposal surfaced publicly on Monday, when Kerry -- responding to a reporter asking what Syria could do to stop a U.S. attack -- suggested that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad \"could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week.\"\\n\"He isn\\'t about to do it, and it can\\'t be done, obviously,\" Kerry added.\\nHis spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, sought to roll back the comments, saying the secretary was simply responding to a \"hypothetical.\"\\nBut it turns out Putin brought the idea up to Obama last week, a senior administration official said Monday night.\\nKerry and Lavrov have also been discussing ways for Moscow to get involved for more than a year, the official said. But U.S. officials didn\\'t realize how serious Russia was until Lavrov seized on Kerry\\'s comment on Monday, the official said.\\nObama\\'s challenge: Convince you on Syria' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'President Donald Trump has just unveiled his plan for turning around the 16-year war in Afghanistan that he and others in his administration admit the US is losing. And it turns out his new strategy looks a lot like President Barack Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s old one.\\nObama had sent tens of thousands more American troops to Afghanistan in the hopes of hammering the Taliban hard enough that the militants would be open to negotiating a peace agreement. He also pressured Pakistan to help the US in the fight by cracking down on the terrorist safe havens inside its lawless border regions and doing more to prevent weapons and fighters from flowing into Afghanistan.\\nTrump seems to be generally following the Obama blueprint, with one major exception. When Obama ordered reinforcements to Afghanistan in 2009, he said they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d start to be withdrawn within 18 months \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a fixed deadline that infuriated critics from both parties. Trump, by contrast, repeatedly stressed in his Monday night address that there was no timetable for how long American troops would remain in Afghanistan. That effectively means the longest war in American history will extend into the indefinite future.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cConditions on the ground, not arbitrary timetables, will guide our strategy from now on,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump said in a speech heavy on harsh rhetoric but strikingly light on details.\\nTrump didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say how many more American troops, if any, would be sent to join the 8,400 already in Afghanistan. That was on purpose: The president said he wanted to keep the enemy guessing (some reports say he may send about 4,000 troops).\\nThroughout his speech, Trump stressed that the US was in Afghanistan for counterterrorism, not nation-building, and that Washington didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care whether or not the country remained a democracy. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very much in keeping with Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s broader embrace of foreign autocrats ranging from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\\xc4\\x9fan to Egyptian strongman Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\\nLike Obama, Trump said Pakistan had to do more to help the US win in Afghanistan and blasted the country for sheltering terrorists. But Trump seemed to go further than his predecessor when he noted that the \"billions and billions\" the US pays to Pakistan may some day dry up.\\nShould he actually cut aid to Pakistan, and label it a state sponsor of terrorism if it continues to harbor terrorists, as some reports indicated he might, Trump will have punished Pakistan more than Obama did. That said, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth noting that Obama witheld $300 million of military support to Pakistan last August.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars, at the same time they are housing the same terrorists that we are fighting. But that will have to change. And that will change immediately,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump said.\\nTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech was many months in the making, with top administration officials repeatedly trying, and failing, to get Trump to make a decision about the way forward in Afghanistan. The president \\xe2\\x80\\x94 backed by advisers like former chief strategist Steve Bannon \\xe2\\x80\\x94 was skeptical about spending more blood and treasure when the Taliban controls more than 40 percent of Afghanistan and is continuing to gain ground.\\nIn the end, though, President Trump abandoned candidate Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s skepticism about Afghanistan and agreed to continue a war he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d long belittled. Trump announced the decision at Fort Myer, the military installation near Arlington Cemetery where some of the 2,258 US troops who died in Afghanistan were laid to rest. It was couched as part of a new and comprehensive strategy for stabilizing both Afghanistan and Pakistan.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe will win,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump declared Monday night.\\nHis predecessors had said the same thing, and were proven wrong. Now it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s turn.\\nTrump has long been skeptical of the war in Afghanistan. He just chose to keep it going.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat are we doing there? These people hate us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump said in a 2012 Fox News appearance, as reported by my colleague Zack Beauchamp. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re spending hundreds of billions of dollars, trillions of dollars, on this nonsense \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and the minute we leave, everything blows up, and the worst guy gets it. The one who hates this country the most will end up taking over Afghanistan.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut after winning the election, Trump called Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in December and told him he would consider sending more troops to Afghanistan, the Wall Street Journal reported. After the conversation, an unnamed Afghan official stated that Trump \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwould certainly continue to support Afghanistan security forces and will consider a proposal for more troops after an assessment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn office, Trump has more vocally asked why the US was doing so poorly in Afghanistan despite spending around $714 billion there over the past 15 years and losing a total of 2,264 troops and civilians.\\n\"We aren\\'t winning,\" he said in a July 19 meeting with his advisers. \"We are losing.\"\\nHe even threatened to replace Gen. John Nicholson, the top commander in Afghanistan, who warned Congress in February that the conflict was at a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstalemate\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and could only be broken by putting thousands more US troops in the region.\\nBut the US intelligence community was less confident that America could soon improve conditions in Afghanistan, even if more troops were sent in.\\n\"The intelligence community assesses that the political and security situation in Afghanistan will almost certainly deteriorate through 2018, even with a modest increase in military assistance by the United States and its partners,\" Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, said to the Senate Intelligence Committee on May 11.\\nMonths of infighting split Trumpworld as it tried to agree on a strategy to deal with an Afghanistan in crisis.\\nOn one side, Vice President Mike Pence and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster advocated sending in more troops to advise and train Afghans to fight the Taliban over the next four years. On the other side, Bannon argued against sending in additional US forces but was open to a proposal by private contractor Erik Prince to replace troops with mercenaries.\\nPrince, the former head the infamous private security firm Blackwater, also proposed installing an American \\xe2\\x80\\x9cviceroy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to run the country and oversee the mercenaries.\\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like the proposal and tried to shut it down. McMaster even blocked Prince from attending a meeting last Friday on Afghanistan at Camp David, the presidential retreat, where Trump said he had made his decision.\\nOther plans were also put in front of Trump, including a gradual troop withdrawal and an ongoing counterterrorism-focused mission with fewer troops than there are now. Trump, however, didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like those options. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think they would stop the country from being overrun by terrorists, and he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to be remembered for letting that happen on his watch, Axios reports.\\nDespite multiple meetings, Trump continually sent proposals back to his national security team for more work. One meeting in July was described to Politico as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshitshow\\xe2\\x80\\x9d where heated \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwords were exchanged.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Over time, officials grew frustrated with one another. At one point, Bannon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s camp labeled Afghanistan as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMcMaster\\xe2\\x80\\x99s War\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because of his push to send troops.\\nThere was even a coordinated right-wing online attack on McMaster to discredit him as Afghanistan deliberations continued. The lead story Monday night on Breitbart, the right-wing website Bannon took over for the second time after being fired by Trump late last week, said Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech was a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cflip-flop\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because it seemed to involve sending more troops.\\nAt some of the meetings, Trump openly lamented that NATO allies \\xe2\\x80\\x94 many of which have been fighting in the war since its start \\xe2\\x80\\x94 weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t doing their fair share to help. The administration has signaled that NATO and the US must increase their troop totals in Afghanistan at the same rate.\\nAll the deliberation led Trump to blow by two deadlines for unveiling the new strategy. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been expected to release the plan before a NATO summit on May 25, but he instead used the occasion to bash allies for not spending enough on defense. Then Mattis told the Senate Armed Services Committee on June 13 that a strategy would be completed by mid-July \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t materialize.\\nAfghanistan is full of problems, including a more powerful Taliban and a corrupt government. The solutions have evaded the past two White Houses. Even the Obama administration had trouble achieving a victory despite overseeing 100,000 troops in 2011, the highest level to date.\\nSome believe a military-focused solution won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be enough to tackle Afghanistan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s issues. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe keep putting Band-Aids on, we keep giving the patient aspirin, but we never do enough to solve the core causes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d David Sedney, a former top Pentagon official focusing on Afghanistan and Pakistan, said in an interview. He added that more troops \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be enough to stop the bleeding and save the patient.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAfghanistan won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be easy to solve, even with a new plan\\nThere are two main issues facing Afghanistan: the growing strength of the Taliban and other terrorist groups and Pakistan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role in failing to curb the crisis.\\nAccording to a recent Pentagon report, there are about 20 terrorist groups operating in the Afghanistan and Pakistan region, including the Taliban, an ISIS offshoot, and al-Qaeda. The US and its allies have been training, advising, and assisting Afghan troops to push back on those militants since Afghanistan took the lead in fighting them three years ago.\\nThe New York Times reports that Afghanistan has about 21,000 special operations forces that perform about 70 to 80 percent of the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fighting, even though they make up only about 7 percent of the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forces.\\nThe good news is the Taliban has not overtaken any provincial capitals or important cities this year, but there is still a lot of violence in the country. The Pentagon notes that from December 1, 2016, to May 31, 2017, enemies attacked 4,806 times.\\nIn the same time period, there were more than 3,600 civilian casualties, about a third of them fatal. The total is about a 33 percent increase compared with the same time frame a year earlier, the Defense Department reported. Getting the Taliban to sit down for some sort of negotiation will be a tough task because of the gains they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also not a new idea. In fact, it was the same thinking the Obama administration used to determine its own strategy for the war. And as much as Trump doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like to be compared to Obama, it might be hard for him to escape the parallels when it comes to Afghanistan.\\nOn December 2, 2009 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 after a year of intense deliberation and review \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Obama announced he was sending 30,000 more US troops into Afghanistan, even though he also announced troops would start to come home 18 months later. Critics inside and outside the military blasted the decision because they said it signaled to the Taliban that they simply had to wait Obama out. That may be part of the reason why Trump chose not to announce a timeline.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are there to make sure that we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have another 9/11 originate in Afghanistan,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Andrew Wilder, an Afghanistan expert at the US Institute of Peace, told me. He was referring to how al-Qaeda was able to plan the attacks in Afghanistan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ungoverned places. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why he feels it is important to commit US troops to the region: to ensure al-Qaeda or other groups don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the time and space to plan that kind of strike again. Trump alluded to 9/11 a few times in his speech, citing the same concerns.\\nAnd then there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Pakistan. Over the years, it has been a strange bedfellow for the US, helping America with counterterrorism missions while serving as a safe haven for terrorists. In his speech, Trump is expected to put more pressure on Pakistan to help stop the crisis there.\\nSedney said Pakistan doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have much of an incentive to help stabilize Afghanistan because of its fears that other countries \\xe2\\x80\\x94 especially India, its historical nemesis \\xe2\\x80\\x94 may use Afghanistan as a base to attack it in the future. A destabilized Afghanistan with terrorists in control of key areas makes it an unsafe place for other countries to station their troops.\\nThat means Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new strategy has to contend with a growing terrorism problem and an ally that has at best a mixed record of helping the US stop the fighting in Afghanistan. Devising the plan was hard for the White House. Making it work will be even harder.\\nCorrection: The Pentagon says 2,264 Americans have died in Afghanistan since 2001. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the death toll was closer to 1,800.' target:-1\n",

They left the 75-minute meeting without talking to reporters. Sen. Collins appeared hopeful that Democrats may be open to reviving the plan.\\n\"Despite [Senate Majority Leader] Sen.

These meetings were constructive and give me hope that a bipartisan solution \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 is within our reach.\"\\nReid rejected the plan -- which calls for funding the government for six months and increasing the federal debt limit through January -- purportedly, in part, because the spending level of $967 billion next year was too low, despite it providing more flexibility in administering the federal budget cuts under sequester.\\nCollins\\xe2\\x80\\x99 plan also calls for a two-year delay on ObamaCare&aposs medical device tax and requires income verification for Americans seeking subsidies for ObamaCare.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSusan Collins is one of my favorite senators, Democrat or Republican,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Reid said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI appreciate her effort, as always, to find a consensus.

      "features:b'LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - The girlfriend of the Las Vegas gunman who killed 58 people and himself in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history was questioned by the FBI on Wednesday and said she had no idea he was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cplanning violence against anyone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMarilou Danley, who returned late on Tuesday from a family visit to the Philippines and is regarded by investigators as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cperson of interest,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said through a lawyer that the carnage Stephen Paddock unleashed while she was abroad caught her completely unaware.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe never said anything to me or took any action that I was aware of that I understood in any way to be a warning that something horrible like this was going to happen,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Danley, 62, said in a written statement read to reporters by her attorney in Los Angeles, where the FBI was questioning her.\\nA Federal Bureau of Investigation official in Las Vegas, meanwhile, said no one has been taken into custody.\\nBut Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters he found it hard to believe that the arsenal of weapons, ammunition and explosives recovered by police in their investigation could have been assembled by Paddock completely on his own.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have to make an assumption that he had some help at some point,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lombardo said at a news briefing. Lombardo said the attack was the obvious outcome of meticulous planning.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat we know is that Stephen Paddock is a man who spent decades acquiring weapons and ammo and living a secret life, much of which will never be fully understood,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the sheriff said.\\nNearly 500 people were also injured when Paddock, 64, strafed an outdoor concert with gunfire on Sunday night from his 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.\\nHe took his own life before police stormed his room, bringing the total death toll to 59.\\nPolice recovered nearly 50 firearms from three locations they searched, nearly half of them from the hotel suite. Twelve of the rifles there were fitted with so-called bump stocks, officials said, allowing the guns to be fired almost as though they were automatic weapons.\\nIn response to a question, Lombardo said investigators were examining the possibility Paddock\\xe2\\x80\\x99s purchase of more than 30 guns in October 2016 may have been precipitated by some triggering event in his life. He did not elaborate.\\nIf Paddock did have any accomplice, there remained no evidence as yet \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto indicate terrorism\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the shooting spree, said Aaron Rouse, FBI special agent in charge of the Las Vegas field office.\\nEarlier in the day, U.S. President Donald Trump visited Las Vegas, marking the first time since taking office that he has had to confront a major mass shooting.\\nIn her statement after being questioned in Los Angeles, Paddock\\xe2\\x80\\x99s girlfriend Danley insisted she knew Paddock as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca kind, caring, quiet man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Her lawyer, Matt Lombard, said Danley was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfully cooperating\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with the investigation.\\nDanley, an Australian citizen of Filipino heritage, said she flew back to the United States voluntarily \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbecause I know that the FBI and Las Vegas Police Department wanted to talk to me, and I wanted to talk to them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nDanley, who was twice married before her relationship with Paddock, became a focus of the investigation for having shared his retirement community condo in Mesquite, Nevada, northeast of Las Vegas, before leaving the United States for the Philippines in mid-September.\\nFBI agents met her plane at Los Angeles International Airport before interviewing her, two U.S. officials briefed on the case told Reuters. As of midday Wednesday, there was no indication she was aware of Paddock\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plans, they said.\\nInvestigators questioned her about Paddock\\xe2\\x80\\x99s weapons purchases, a $100,000 wire transfer to a Philippine bank that appeared to be intended for her, and whether she saw any changes in his behavior before she left the United States.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAssuming she had no role in his actions, the most important thing is any light she can shed on Paddock\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motive,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one official, who spoke about the investigation on condition of anonymity.\\nDanley said Paddock had bought her an airline ticket to visit her family and wired her money to purchase property there, leading her to worry he might be planning to break up with her.\\nPaddock\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brother Eric told reporters the $100,000 transfer was evidence that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSteve took care of the people he loved,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that he likely wanted to protect Danley by sending her overseas before the attack.\\nShe arrived in Manila on Sept. 15, flew to Hong Kong on Sept. 22, returned to Manila on Sept. 25 and was there until she flew to Los Angeles on Tuesday night, according to a Philippine immigration official.\\nDiscerning Paddock\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motive has proven especially baffling given the absence of the indicators typical in other mass shootings. He had no criminal record, no known history of mental illness and no outward signs of social disaffection, political discontent or extremist ideology, police said.\\nTrump, touring a hospital in Las Vegas, told reporters Paddock was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery demented,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and he asked Lombardo if investigators were any closer to establishing a motive.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had a couple good leads and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re working our way through it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told the president.\\n(To view a graphic on the Las Vegas attack, click tmsnrt.rs/2yRHHDI)\\nAdditional reporting by Steve Holland and Lisa Girion in Las Vegas, Karen Freifeld and Jonathan Allen in New York, Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles, Manuel Mogato in Manila and John Walcott and Mark Hosenball in Washington; Writing by Daniel Trotta and Steve Gorman; Editing by Jonathan Oatis, Toni Reinhold, Grant McCool' target:0\n",
      "features:b'Some 9 million Americans could attend community college tuition-free under a proposal President Barack Obama announced Friday.\\nHis plan, which is subject to approval by Congress and depends on the participation of state governments, would dedicate some $60 billion over the next decade to defray tuition and fees for anyone who attends school at least half-time, maintains a roughly C+ average, and is on track to complete their program or transfer to a four-year school. The federal government would kick in about 75 percent of the cost, while participating states would pick up the rest. For the neediest students, Pell grants would help pay for transportation, room and board, and other costs associated with attending college.\\nStudent advocates said the plan could boost college enrollment, slow the growth of student debt, put dodgy for-profit colleges out of business, and force schools, state governments and local governments to dedicate more resources to helping students attain a college degree.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThink about it: Students who started at community colleges during those two years, and then go on to a four-year institution -- they essentially get the first half of their bachelor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s degree for free,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Obama told an audience at Pellissippi State Community College in Knoxville, Tennessee. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople who enroll for skills training will graduate already ready to work, and they won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a pile of student debt.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nFor an administration that has struggled to help student loan borrowers or crack down on wayward colleges and student loan contractors that waste taxpayer funds, student advocates said that the mere fact that Obama was proposing free higher education represented progress in their fight for reduced debt burdens and lower tuition costs. Even if Obama leaves the White House in January 2017 without having seen his proposal passed into law, they said, future Democratic leaders likely would have to embrace it as part of their own plan to aid students and families.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTwo years of college will become as free and universal as high school is today,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Obama said. His education secretary, Arne Duncan, said on Twitter: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust as free K-12 education is an educational and civil right, #FreeCommunityCollege should be as well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIt faces an uphill climb. Influential Washington Republicans immediately pounced on the idea, dismissing it as federal overreach. Congress has declined to approve previous community college-oriented proposals from the Obama administration.\\nAnd even though the plan is similar to one adopted by Tennessee -- the site of Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s address Friday -- the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s senior U.S. senator, Lamar Alexander, said he wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t support it because the federal government shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get involved. Alexander, a Republican, this week became the new chair of the Senate education committee.\\nWith Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress, political analysts said the measure has little chance of being enacted into law.\\nThe plan does nothing for existing students. As a result of reduced state funding for higher education and recent moves by Washington to reduce federal spending, those students have had to contend with a shrinking pot of money to aid them as they complete their degrees. It also fails to help borrowers with student loans, of which there are 40 million who collectively carry more than $1.3 trillion in unpaid education debts.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs a borrower with student loan debt, I am still awaiting the proposal that will help existing borrowers like me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Natalia Abrams, executive director of the activist group Student Debt Crisis.\\nThe White House declined to provide more details about the proposal, which Obama said he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll highlight again during his upcoming State of the Union address. The administration said it will reveal more details of the plan, and how it plans to pay for it, in the coming weeks as part of its budget for the next fiscal year.\\nStudents paid community colleges $16.7 billion in tuition and fees in 2012, comprising nearly 30 percent, or the largest portion, of their total revenue during the most recent year for which data is available, according to the American Association of Community Colleges.\\nThe average community college is charging students about $3,347 in tuition and fees this academic year, the trade group said. That represents about 21 percent of the typical student\\'s cost to attend community college, or about $16,325.\\nFor-profit colleges, which compete with community colleges for non-traditional and vocational students, and generally charge much higher rates, would be among the losers if Obama\\'s plan became law.\\nInvestors in publicly-traded for-profit colleges reacted by sending shares of the biggest for-profit education companies down by as much as 6 percent on Friday, far exceeding the slight drops in U.S. equity benchmarks. The Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities, the trade group representing for-profit schools, did not return a request for comment.\\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), a frequent critic of proprietary schools, praised Obama\\'s plan for steering students toward community colleges, which he said are \"a more affordable, higher quality alternative to for-profit colleges.\"\\nStudents would benefit beyond the promise of free tuition. For example, improved coordination between community colleges and public four-year schools as a result of Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan could help transfer students avoid having to spend unnecessary money to repeat coursework. House Democrats said last year that some 15 percent of transfer students lost at least 90 percent of their community college credits when moving to their new school.\\nObama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan could benefit the broader American economy thanks to a better-educated workforce, which he said was key to the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to compete in the global economy.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the new economy, jobs and businesses will go wherever the most skilled, best-educated workforce resides. Because businesses are mobile now. Technology means they can locate anywhere. And where they have the most educated, most adaptable, most nimble workforce, that\\'s where they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to locate. And I want them to look no further than the United States of America,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Obama said.\\nExperts said his plan could also help lower-income students overcome the perception that college was out of reach.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis sends a clear message that community college is an affordable option for all students. Even though tuition and fees make up a small portion of the total cost of attendance -- and it is unclear if all students will see additional savings from this plan -- telling students early on that tuition will be free may induce more to prepare for college and eventually enroll,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Robert Kelchen, a professor at Seton Hall University who specializes in higher education finance.\\nTo Ben Miller, a former adviser to Arne Duncan, one of the plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best features lies in the message it sends to states, namely that they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t keep cutting funding for higher education.\\n\"It\\'s not the free part that stands out. It\\'s the formal financial requirement for states to fund their higher education institutions,\" said Miller, a senior policy analyst at the Washington-based New America Foundation who previously worked at the Education Department. \"It\\'s the first time from the federal government, this stated notion that states have an actual obligation in a formal sense for supporting their higher education. States been free for decades to cut or fund higher education on their whims.\"\\nThe Government Accountability Office in a report last month said that in the decade ending in 2012 tuition and fees from students overtook state funds as the larger source of revenue for public colleges.\\nObama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan, if enacted, risks subsidizing students from higher-income families who may not need help from taxpayers. Debbie Cochrane, research director for the California-based Institute for College Access & Success, said making tuition free for all students represents \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca missed opportunity to focus resources on the students who need aid the most.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nCochrane pointed to California\\xe2\\x80\\x99s community colleges, which she said offer the lowest tuition rates in the nation and fee waivers for low-income students, as an example of why a free tuition plan may not help the neediest students. Few low-income students apply for federal student aid at California\\xe2\\x80\\x99s community colleges, and part-time enrollment is high.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cObama probably won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get this done in the next couple years, but he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s laying the groundwork with his message,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sara Goldrick-Rab, an education policy expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who for years has advocated for free tuition during students\\xe2\\x80\\x99 first two years in college. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get free high school overnight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'WASHINGTON \\xe2\\x80\\x95 House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is done defending Donald Trump, but he won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t unendorse him \\xe2\\x80\\x95 at least, not yet.\\nRyan told Republican members of Congress on a conference call Monday that they \\xe2\\x80\\x9call need to do what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best for you in your district,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d according to someone on the call. Ryan said he wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t campaign with Trump for the rest of the election, but added that he wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t withdraw his endorsement of the GOP nominee.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe made clear to members that his decisions are being driven by what is best for his members, not himself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the source on the call said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is willing to endure political pressure to help protect our majority.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nRyan seems to be suggesting that he would unendorse Trump if he were on his own. But the speaker is not on his own, and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s signaling that he believes there would be a negative down-ballot effect for Republicans if he were to pull his support.\\nThe conference call was held after a leaked video revealed that Trump had, in 2005, bragged about groping and kissing women without their consent. Amid a steady stream of Republicans unendorsing Trump, many party members are questioning whether they, too, should withdraw their support of the nominee and risk angering Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s base and depressing GOP turnout even more. Not unendorsing means forever associating yourself with Trump and telling voters that Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behavior is still acceptable. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the bind Republicans have been in all along, but Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recently disclosed behavior exacerbates it.\\nOn top of that, the Trump tarnish becomes more difficult to avoid as more members unendorse Trump. The question of why you, as a Congressman, find Trump to be acceptable becomes more pointed the more Republicans withdraw their support.\\nThat question is particularly difficult for Ryan. The speaker has struggled with his Trump endorsement from the very beginning, first by withholding it, then by offering it while continuing to criticize Trump. More to the point, Trump has made it difficult for Republicans like Ryan to support him, as he has called immigrants rapists, proposed banning Muslim immigrants and \\xe2\\x80\\x95 among so many other outrages \\xe2\\x80\\x95 said a judge couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be fair because he was of Mexican heritage.\\nThat last offense, involving federal Judge Gonzalo Curiel, became a flashpoint between Trump and Ryan when the speaker described the GOP nominee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s positions as \\xe2\\x80\\x9csort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nStill, Ryan has stood by Trump, and neither the GOP nominee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lewd comments released Friday nor the call on Monday has changed that.\\nDiscussion was spirited during the call, according to sources, as some pro-Trump members spoke up in support of the nominee. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) said he would gladly sacrifice his congressional seat if it meant preventing a Hillary Clinton presidency, and Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) dismissed Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s comments as \\xe2\\x80\\x9clocker room talk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that paled in comparison to the importance of a Republican nominating a Supreme Court justice.\\nRepublicans also used the call to update members on the state of House races.\\nNational Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) talked about how the environment for Republicans has been changing rapidly. Walden previously touted the ability of House Republicans to avoid down-ballot troubles, but said the situation has gotten worse for Republicans since the first debate and that things would change after Friday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s comments.\\nWalden advised members to do polling in their district to understand what voters are thinking, and he pressed Republicans to give any extra money they have to the NRCC.\\nRyan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advice that Republicans should do what they need to is also a recognition of the state of House races. Without evidence yet of the polling impact, Republicans seem to think they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in a rapidly deteriorating position with voters, and that dumping Trump could be the only course ahead for some members \\xe2\\x80\\x95 either because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re concerned about re-election or their sense of responsibility.\\nThis article has been updated throughout.\\nEditor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \\xe2\\x80\\x94 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \\xe2\\x80\\x94 from entering the U.S.' target:-1\n",

      "features:b'WASHINGTON -- The House of Representatives has passed a health care measure that would repeal much of Obamacare.\\nThe GOP-crafted American Health Care Act made it through on a vote of 217 to 213. It now heads to the Senate where it is expected to face fierce debate.\\nAlthough the measure will likely see changes once in the Senate, as it stands now, here are five things the bill does:\\nMany pro-life Republicans have praised the bill for blocking federal funding for Planned Parenthood.\\n\"It\\'s about time that Planned Parenthood start looking somewhere else for revenue rather than American taxpayers, who have no interest in funding abortion. House leadership should be commended for listening to their constituents and getting a bill passed that defunds Planned Parenthood, the nation\\'s largest abortion vendor,\" said Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life.\\nAmericans United for Life\\'s Acting President and Senior Counsel Clarke Forsythe said, \"American taxpayers should not be responsible for subsidizing Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry.\"\\n\"The House\\'s 217-213 vote today would remove funding from Planned Parenthood for the next year and redirect that money to the full-service Federally Qualified Health Centers and community health centers across the nation that outnumber Planned Parenthood 20 to 1,\" he added.\\nOther backers of the bill include some members of the House Freedom Caucus who\\'d opposed the first draft of American Health Care Act.\\n\"If you vote no now then you\\'re telling your constituents, \\'Oh, I only voted to repeal Obamacare when I knew it wouldn\\'t count or if the president would veto it. I was just playing a game I never had any intention to repeal it,\\' and yet most everybody in our party has been on camera saying I support full repeal of Obamacare,\" Congressman Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, told CBN News.\\n\"Well this isn\\'t even full repeal,\" he noted \"You can\\'t even vote for partial repeal when it\\'s going to help bring premiums down? And I know there\\'s concerns about some people\\'s premiums going up, but we have got to bring premium downs for the majority of the American people. We have just got to -- they can\\'t stand it anymore.\"\\nDespite the victory of the measure in the House, as it heads to the Senate there are still many questions surrounding the bill. Cost is one concern. The Congressional Budget Office has not yet released an estimated cost for this version of the bill.\\nAnother area of concern is pre-existing conditions. The bill allows states to get federal waivers that would free insurers from other Obamacare coverage requirements. With waivers, insurers could charge people with preexisting conditions higher rates than their peers and raise prices for older consumers.\\nA last-minute amendment to the measure includes $8 billion over five years to cover such conditions. That amendment helped secure enough votes to narrowly get the measure through the house.\\nAmid the remaining questions about the measure, 20 Republicans voted against it. All voting Democrats also voted no.\\nStay informed with the latest from CBN News delivered to your inbox.' target:1\n",

Still, across the Arab world, his harsh words for Israel were met with a collective shrug, coming at the end of eight years of Obama administration policies that left many in the Middle East frustrated.\\nOn Capitol Hill, hours after Mr. Kerry used what may be his last major address to bluntly inform the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfriends need to tell each other the hard truths,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he received a reminder of the deep support Israel enjoys in an otherwise sharply divided Congress.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhile he may not have intended it, I fear Secretary Kerry, in his speech and action at the U.N., has emboldened extremists on both sides,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Senator Chuck Schumer, the incoming Senate Democratic leader.\\nA bipartisan chorus of lawmakers, upset with President Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision last week to allow the passage of a United Nations resolution condemning Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s construction of settlements in disputed territory, made clear that they were looking past the departing administration.\\nSenator Benjamin L.

Britain and France, both members of the Security Council, voted for the resolution on settlements, and France has been extremely active in pressing for a kind of peace conference, to which the Israelis have objected.\\nIn the Arab world, analysts said the Obama administration should have spoken out sooner.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt the last five minutes of the hour, apparently Kerry and Obama are showing some courage to stand up to Israel, but it is coming too late in the game,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a professor of political science in the United Arab Emirates. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is after the fact.

The perpetrator, firing from the window of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, murdered 58 people and shot more than 400 others. In total, there were more than 800 victims. MGM Resorts owns Mandalay Bay.\\nThe suit, which was filed in court last Friday, claims that suits against MGM relating to the massacre \"must be dismissed\" because MGM has \"no liability of any kind to defendants,\" the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. The newspaper explained:\\nIn this case, the company argues, the security vendor MGM hired for Route 91, Contemporary Services Corp., was protected from liability because its services had been certified by the Department of Homeland Security for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprotecting against and responding to acts of mass injury and destruction.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBecause MGM hired the security company for the Route 91 country music festival, the protection extends to MGM, the lawsuit argues.\\nMGM does not seek damages against the massacre victims. Instead, its filing only asks a judge to consider whether the 2002 law extends its protections to MGM, and if so, to disallow future civil litigation against MGM relating to the tragedy.\\nDebra DeShong, a spokesperson for MGM, said MGM\\'s filing will provide a \"timely\" resolution for victims.\\n\"Years of drawn out litigation and hearings are not in the best interest of victims, the community and those still healing,\" she said, according to the Review-Journal.\\nThe filing comes after more than 450 victims and their families filed a lawsuit against a number of entities, including MGM and the killer\\'s estate, last November.

      "features:b'PARIS \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Andreas Lubitz was breathing, steady and calm, in the final moments of Germanwings Flight 9525. It was the only sound from within the cockpit that the voice recorder detected as Mr. Lubitz, the co-pilot, sent the plane into its descent.\\nThe sounds coming from outside the cockpit door on Tuesday were something else altogether: knocking and pleading from the commanding pilot that he be let in, then violent pounding on the door and finally passengers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 screams moments before the plane, carrying 150 people, slammed into a mountainside in the French Alps.\\nThose clues led French prosecutors to say Thursday that the co-pilot had locked the pilot out of the cockpit and deliberately crashed the plane.\\nThe sound of Mr. Lubitz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s breathing indicated that he was conscious to the end, Brice Robin, the Marseille public prosecutor, said at a news conference. It appeared that Mr. Lubitz intended \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto destroy the aircraft,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe interpretation we can give at this time is that the co-pilot, through a deliberate act, refused to open the door of the cockpit to the commander, and activated the button that commands the loss of altitude,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Robin said.\\nData from the plane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s transponder also suggested that the person at the controls had manually reset the autopilot to take the plane from 38,000 feet to 96 feet, the lowest possible setting, according to Flightradar24, a flight tracking service. The aircraft struck a mountainside at 6,000 feet.\\nBefore Mr. Lubitz, 27, a German citizen, set the plane on its 10-minute descent about half an hour into the flight from Barcelona, Spain, to D\\xc3\\xbcsseldorf, Germany, the cockpit voice recorder picked up only the usual pilot banter, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccourteous\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccheerful\\xe2\\x80\\x9d exchanges, the prosecutor said.\\nThen the commanding pilot asked Mr. Lubitz to take over. A seat can be heard being pulled back and a door closing as the captain exits the cockpit.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt this stage, the co-pilot is in control, alone,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Robin said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is when he is alone that the co-pilot manipulates the flight monitoring system to activate the descent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The revelation that one of the pilots had been locked out of the cockpit was first reported by The New York Times.\\nInvestigators do not know exactly what happened or why Mr. Lubitz might have intentionally crashed the aircraft. But the flight recording shows the plane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s last moments stretching into an eternity of mounting frustration and panic as the pilot, returning minutes later, is unable to re-enter the cabin.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can hear the commanding pilot ask for access to the cockpit several times,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the prosecutor said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe identifies himself, but the co-pilot does not provide any answer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe German authorities and Lufthansa have declined to identify the commanding pilot because of privacy restrictions, but British and Spanish newspapers have named him as Capt. Patrick Sonderheimer.\\nDuring the descent, Mr. Robin said, air traffic controllers repeatedly tried to contact the aircraft but got no response. Nor did anyone on the plane convey a distress signal, even as the captain desperately tried to break down the door and, at the last, people began screaming.\\nThe prosecutor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assertions instantly changed the nature of the investigation of the crash, which obliterated the Airbus A320 and killed people from more than a dozen countries, into a criminal inquiry focused on Mr. Lubitz.\\nProsecutors said that he had no obvious reason to commit mass murder, and that he had been hired by the airline less than two years ago. The top executive of Lufthansa, the parent of Germanwings, said he was speechless at the news from investigators in France.\\nFriends said Mr. Lubitz, a gliding enthusiast and former flight attendant, was unassuming and funny. He loved to fly and came from the German town of Montabaur but had an apartment in D\\xc3\\xbcsseldorf.\\nMr. Robin, the French prosecutor, said the voice recorder showed details of the final 30 minutes of the flight. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDuring the first 20 minutes, the pilots talk normally,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is nothing abnormal happening.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMr. Robin said that there was no indication that this had been a terrorist attack, and that Mr. Lubitz had not been familiar to law enforcement officials.\\nThe German interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\\xc3\\xa8re, told reporters in Berlin on Thursday that security officials had found no indication that anyone on board had links to terrorism.\\nAsked if Mr. Lubitz had essentially committed suicide, Mr. Robin said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t used the word suicide,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d adding that it was \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca legitimate question to ask.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut Carsten Spohr, the chief executive of Lufthansa and a former A320 pilot, suggested that what Mr. Lubitz had done was something of a different magnitude. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not a legal expert,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, adding, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf a person takes 149 other people to their deaths with him, there is another word than suicide.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are horrified that something of this nature could have taken place,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is the worst nightmare that anyone can have in our company.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He said Lufthansa staff received psychological and flight training.\\nAfter a Cairo-bound EgyptAir flight went down in 1999 in the Atlantic Ocean off Nantucket, Mass., killing 217 people, investigators said they suspected that the co-pilot might have committed suicide. The United States National Transportation Safety Board, which investigated, concluded that the crash had occurred because of the co-pilot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmanipulation of the airplane controls,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d although its report explicitly did not refer to suicide.\\nInvestigators into the Germanwings crash said they were trying to determine why the captain had left the cockpit. To get back in would have required a precise procedure.\\nMembers of a flight crew would typically use a fail-safe code to open the door if someone in the cockpit could not or would not let them in. The pilot would have known the code, Mr. Spohr said, but it was unclear whether he had used it. Even if he did, the co-pilot could have activated a switch that prevented the door from opening for five minutes, or found some other way to block the door, Mr. Spohr said. There is no chance the pilot forgot the code, he said.\\nStefan Schaffrath, an Airbus spokesman, said Thursday that after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States, Airbus had upgraded the reinforcements of cockpit doors.\\nAccording to an Airbus video, the cockpit door is locked by default when closed. But when a pilot wants to lock it to bar access to someone, he or she can move the toggle to a position marked \\xe2\\x80\\x9clocked,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which illuminates a red light on a numeric code pad outside. That disables the door, keypad and the door buzzer for five minutes.\\nWhile these functions are disabled, the video shows, the only way to contact the crew is via an intercom. The door can then be opened only if someone inside moves and holds the toggle switch to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunlock\\xe2\\x80\\x9d position.\\nIf someone outside the cockpit suspects the pilot is incapacitated, that person would normally first try to establish contact via the intercom or by activating a buzzer. If that was unsuccessful, the video shows, a crew member outside the cockpit would need to enter an emergency code on the keypad.\\nThe code activates a loud buzzer and flashing light on the cockpit control panel, and it sets off a timer that unlocks the door 30 seconds later. The person outside has five seconds to enter before the door locks again.\\nDominique Fouda, a spokesman for the European Aviation Safety Agency in Cologne, said that there was no requirement in Europe for a cabin crew member to be in the cockpit when one of the pilots leaves for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cphysiological reasons.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBasically, unless they have a physiological need, they have to be in the cockpit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nAviation safety experts said that the standards in the United States were similar, although Laura Brown, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration in Washington, said she could not immediately confirm that.\\nAs investigators continued to pore over the clues, and search crews scoured the rough French terrain for more, relatives of the victims began arriving Thursday near the site of the crash, where a makeshift chapel has been set up, and where psychologists are providing support. Lufthansa was to operate two special flights for family members from Barcelona and from D\\xc3\\xbcsseldorf.

      "features:b'WASHINGTON \\xe2\\x80\\x94 When Jeb Bush decides whether to run for president, there will be no family meeting \\xc3\\xa0 la Mitt Romney, no gathering at Walker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Point in Kennebunkport to go over the pros and cons. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be like a big internal straw poll,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said his son, Jeb Bush Jr.\\nBut if there were, the results of the poll are pretty much in. As Mr. Bush nears a decision to become the third member of his storied family to seek the presidency, the extended Bush clan and its attendant network, albeit with one prominent exception, are largely rallying behind the prospect and pulling the old machine out of the closet.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo question,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jeb Jr. said in an interview, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpeople are getting fired up about it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 donors and people who have been around the political process for a while, people he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s known in Tallahassee when he was governor. The family, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re geared up either way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Most important, he added, his mother, Columba, the prospective candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s politics-averse wife, has given her assent.\\nWithin the family, the top cheerleaders have been George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush, both of whom know something about running for president, and both of whom have an interest in perpetuating, if not redeeming, the family legacy. Barbara Bush, the former first lady and Jeb Bush\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother, is unconvinced, according to people close to the family, but has been persuaded to stop saying it so publicly. George P. Bush, his other son, who is running for Texas land commissioner, has been supportive of what he calls a likely run.\\nAnd then there is the larger Bush clan, the vast constellation of friends, advisers, strategists, pollsters, fund-raisers, donors and supporters assembled over several generations in public life. With Jeb Bush, the former two-term governor of Florida, comes one more chance to reach the top. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re like horses in the stall waiting for the gate to break,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one family insider who has known Jeb Bush for decades and like others did not want to be named. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all jumping up and down.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nJust six years ago, at the end of the last tumultuous Bush presidency, this would have been all but unthinkable. But President Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s troubles, the internal divisions of the Republican Party, a newfound nostalgia for the first Bush presidency and a modest softening of views about the second have changed the dynamics enough to make plausible another Bush candidacy. And while Jeb Bush wants to run as his own man, invariably this is a family with something to prove.\\nFor the elder Mr. Bush, Jeb was always the son expected to go far in politics, the serious one with drive to spare. After George W. gave up drinking and surpassed his brother, the elder Mr. Bush still harbored ambitions for the second son. Now 90 and in fading health, Mr. Bush has been animated about a possible Jeb campaign, according to friends.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf it were up to his father, he would be a candidate,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jim McGrath, a spokesman for the former president. But the Bushes are wary of the presumption of a dynasty.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re very sensitive to the idea that anyone might think the family feels entitled to the nomination,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. McGrath said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFirst of all, it just wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be true. And second of all, they understand it would be poison to a candidacy if that perception were ever to get out there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAs for George W., he has not been especially close to Jeb, who is seven years younger. By all accounts, the former president is closer to their younger brother, Marvin, who visited him in the White House or at Camp David regularly.\\nBut George W. has become an outspoken advocate of a White House bid by Jeb. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe one person who is really, really trying to get Jeb to run is George W.,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the family insider. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talking it up all the time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe former president lobbied Jeb when the two saw each other in Dallas several weeks ago, but he acknowledged with a laugh that his pressure could backfire. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think he liked it that his older brother was pushing him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Bush told Fox News afterward.\\nNone of that means Jeb Bush will run. He has said he will decide by the end of the year, and could simply be keeping the possibility open to enhance his influence on the political stage. To some who have spoken with him in recent months, he has not exhibited the same fire that his father and brother did at this stage.\\nAdvisers to Mr. Bush said he has not authorized anyone to line up money or people to work for him. Some of the positions he has taken on immigration, taxes and education are at odds with the prevailing orthodoxy of his party. He knows he would have to find a way to distance himself from some of the unpopular decisions of his father, and especially of his brother, while overcoming broader Bush fatigue.\\nAnd he has said publicly he does not want to run if it means getting caught in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvortex of a mud fight,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d acutely aware of the perils of bringing his family into the harsh light of modern politics. Columba was once stopped by customs agents for not declaring the full value of $19,000 in clothing and jewelry she bought in Paris, and their daughter Noelle was arrested on a prescription drug fraud charge a dozen years ago.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe has certainly not given anyone I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m aware of the ability to have conversations with potential donors or staff to keep his powder dry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sally Bradshaw, a longtime adviser. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t call us and say we want Jeb to run. But he has not given a green light to that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nHaving said that, Mr. Bush has been active on the campaign trail, effectively building up chits. He has appeared at more than 35 campaign events for such figures as Governors Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, Susana Martinez of New Mexico, Mary Fallin of Oklahoma and Rick Snyder of Michigan and Senate candidates like Joni Ernst in Iowa, Tom Cotton in Arkansas and Cory Gardner in Colorado.\\nHe has cultivated the family network as well, appearing at an anniversary of his father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s administration held in College Station, Tex., last spring and speaking to many other family supporters at his brother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presidential library outside Dallas several weeks ago. The family believes the party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s money men have been waiting for Jeb and will give him an instant foundation if he runs, making him an establishment favorite against the insurgent conservative wing of the party.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Bush network is definitely there, and a lot of good feelings about both 41 and 43 and what they stood for \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a lot of that translates to Jeb,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mark Langdale, former president of the George W. Bush Foundation who saw him in Dallas. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe had a great record in Florida. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s somebody who could bring a lot of different groups together. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a thoughtful guy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn an interview that aired on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis Week\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on ABC News on Sunday, George P. Bush said that he thought it was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmore than likely\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that his father would run. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you had asked me a few years back, I would have said it was less likely,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nFriends and relatives took notice when Jeb Bush told a reporter during a campaign swing for his son that his wife would support a bid should he make one. Jeb Bush Jr. said that was important. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a big fan of politics and all the ugly things that go along with it, especially as it seems like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gotten worse with every passing cycle,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut she loves Dad and she loves the country, and I think she\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be supportive.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nJeb Bush Jr. said his father would make a decision after next week\\xe2\\x80\\x99s midterm elections, informed by experience no other possible candidate has had.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one guy out there who knows how to run a presidential campaign, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definitely him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been around it, really, since 1980.

A producer for CNN was injured during the confrontation, witnesses said.\\nMany Brazilians are furious over the $11.3 billion spent on hosting the World Cup when basic social services are poorly financed. Their pessimism has so far overshadowed a brighter mood among the some 800,000 foreign tourists expected to come to Brazil for the event.\\nMuch of Sao Paulo, Brazil\\'s biggest city and business capital, resembled a ghost town early on Thursday after a partial holiday was declared to ensure traffic to the stadium would be light.\\nBut excitement began to spread by mid-morning.

      "features:b\"The two-year budget agreement crafted by Sen. Patty Murray and Rep. Paul Ryan can best be understood as a deal that is convenient for members of Congress. It is pretty bad news for the rest of the country.\\nThe convenience for members of Congress is straightforward. We have seen several dramatic standoffs over the budget and extensions of the debt ceiling since the Republicans took control of the House in 2010. This has led to one government shutdown and twice brought us to the brink of the government's default on its debt.\\nWhile these standoffs have been bad news for the country -- especially the shutdown, which meant services were not provided and workers were not paid -- they were probably worse news for members of Congress. They had to spend many late nights haggling over deals, and their approval ratings tumbled in opinion polls.\\nIn this way, the two-year budget deal is good news for Congress, because it means there won't be any major budget standoffs until at least 2015. This gets them at least through the election year.\\nThe story for the rest of the country is not as good. First, it is important to note one of the items not included in the deal. There was no extension of unemployment benefits. As a result, more than 1 million laid off workers will see their benefits cut off in 2014. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this will slow growth by 0.2 percentage points and reduce the number of jobs by around 300,000.\\nOf course, Congress could still vote to extend benefits when it comes back in January. Even if this does happen, however, many unemployed workers will still up ending missing one or two checks.\\nWhile Congress did do some reshuffling of funds to make the sequester cuts less painful, one item on the reshuffling list deserves special attention. The budget deal would require that federal employees increase their contributions to their retirement, effectively cutting their pay by another 1%. This cut comes on top of pay freezes that effectively cut real wages by more than 5% over the last three years. Apparently, Congress has not yet tired of beating on air traffic controllers, food inspectors and other members of the federal work force.\\nBut the biggest issue for most of the public is that this is a federal budget that will continue to impose a drag on the economy by preventing the sort of growth that we need to return to full employment. While the stimulus approved by Congress boosted growth and added between 2-3 million jobs, the steep deficit reduction of the last three years has slowed the economy, costing millions of jobs.\\nThe basic point is straightforward. The economy still does not have a source of demand to replace the demand generated by the housing bubble. Bubble-inflated house prices led to a record pace of construction and a consumption boom as homeowners spent based on their illusory bubble-generated housing equity.\\nWith the bubble gone, we are missing close to $1 trillion in annual demand in the economy. There is no mechanism in the private sector that will cause it to replace this demand on its own. Businesses don't invest just because we profess love for job creators. They invest when they see demand, which is not the case in the current economy.\\nIn the longer term, we can hope to replace the bubble-generated demand of the last decade with more net exports. This would come about through a lower-valued dollar that would make our goods more competitive internationally. However, we are not going to see a lower-valued dollar tomorrow. This means that as a simple matter of logic the only way to replace the demand lost due to the collapse of the housing bubble is through the government.\\nBut the budget deal negotiated by Murray and Ryan will do nothing to expand demand in the economy. They could have devoted funds to rebuilding the infrastructure, retrofitting homes and businesses to make them more energy efficient, and improving health care and education. Instead we see further cuts that will both lead to deteriorating service and fewer jobs.\\nThis means that millions of people will continue to be unemployed or underemployed for the foreseeable future and workers will lack the bargaining power to secure their share of economic growth. But at least the lives of members of Congress will be easier.\\nHappy holidays!\\nFollow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.\\nJoin us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.\" target:-1\n",

The rebels blamed the government, the government denied involvement and Russia accused the rebels of staging the attack to implicate President Bashar al-Assad\\xe2\\x80\\x99s government.\\nImages of death and chaos poured out of Syria after what may be the single deadliest attack in more than two years of civil war. Videos posted online showed dozens of lifeless bodies, men wrapped in burial shrouds and children, some still in diapers.

But the subsequent conclusion by the White House that the Syrian Army had used chemical weapons did not bring about a marked shift in American engagement.\\nThis latest attack, by far the largest chemical strike yet alleged, could tip that balance \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as many foes of Mr. Assad hope it will.\\nBut like so much in Syria, where the government bars most reporters from working and the opposition heavily filters the information it lets out, the truth remains elusive.\\nThe attack was especially conspicuous given the presence in Damascus of a team sent by the United Nations to investigate chemical strikes reportedly waged earlier in the war. The United States, the European Union and other world powers called for the investigators to visit the site of Wednesday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attack.\\nThe Security Council, meeting in emergency session, issued a statement calling for a prompt investigation of the allegations and a cease-fire in the conflict, but took no further action.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can say that there is a strong concern among Council members about the allegations and a general sense that there must be clarity on what happened, and that the situation has to be followed carefully,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mar\\xc3\\xada Cristina Perceval of Argentina, the president of the Council, after the meeting. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll Council members agreed that any use of chemical weapons, by any side under any circumstances, is a violation of international law.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe ranking diplomat from Britain, Philip Parham, told reporters later outside the Security Council chambers that representatives of at least 35 countries had signed a letter to Secretary General Ban Ki-moon requesting that Syrian authorities grant the United Nations investigative panel in Syria \\xe2\\x80\\x9curgent access\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to the attack site.\\nBut Mr. Parham declined to specify the signatories or to divulge whether any of the 15 Security Council members had proposed any stronger measures during their closed-door consultations.\\nIn the opposition\\xe2\\x80\\x99s account of the deadly events, Mr. Assad\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forces deployed poison gas on a number of rebel-held suburbs east of Damascus, the capital. They described medics finding people dead in their homes.\\nVideos posted online showed mostly men and children, but the opposition activists said that many women were killed too, but that out of respect they were not photographed.\\nThe actual death toll remained unclear. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said late Wednesday that more than 130 people had been confirmed dead in attacks around Damascus, though it could not confirm the use of gas. Other opposition estimates put the death toll at more than 1,000.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI saw many children lying on beds as if they were sleeping, but unfortunately they were dead,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said an activist reached via Skype in the suburb of Erbin, who gave his name as Abu Yassin.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe thought this regime would not use chemical weapons, at least these days with the presence of the U.N. inspectors,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is reckless. The regime is saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nOthers said that field hospitals were overwhelmed with the number of patients and that many ran out of medication. An activist who gave only his first name, Mohammed, said the dead in one suburb, Zamalka, were laid out in front of a mosque, where a voice over loudspeakers called on residents to identify their relatives.\\nThe video record posted online did not provide enough detail to draw a complete picture of what happened. Unlike the videos often uploaded by the opposition, the images on Wednesday did not show the immediate aftermath of the attacks in the communities.\\nThe videos, experts said, also did not prove the use of chemical weapons, which interfere with the nervous system and can cause defecation, vomiting, intense salivation and tremors. Only some of those symptoms were visible in some patients.\\nGwyn Winfield, editor of CBRNe World, a journal that covers unconventional weapons, said that the medics would most likely have been sickened by exposure to so many people dosed with chemical weapons \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a phenomenon not seen in the videos. He said that the victims could have been killed by tear gas used in a confined space, or by a diluted form of a more powerful chemical agent. Others suggested that toxic industrial chemicals might have been used.\\nSome witness testimony suggested that residents, used to seeking cover from government shelling and airstrikes by running into underground shelters, had made the situation worse. In one video, a young medic said that residents had hidden in their basements, where the gas collected and suffocated them.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe descent of the citizens into the basements increased the number of wounded and the number of martyrs,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the medic said, before breaking into tears and adding that many from the medical corps also succumbed to the gases.\\nIt was not clear whether the team sent to Syria by the United Nations would be able to investigate the new reported attacks. The team arrived Sunday after months of negotiations with the Syrian government and is authorized to visit only three predetermined sites.\\nThe White House said that Syria should provide access to the United Nations, and that those found to have used chemical weapons should be held accountable. Other countries, including Britain and France, offered similar expressions of concern.\\nRussia wrote off the attack as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpreplanned provocation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d orchestrated by the rebels and said they had launched the gas with a homemade rocket from an area they controlled.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll of this looks like an attempt at all costs to create a pretext for demanding that the U.N. Security Council side with opponents of the regime and undermine the chances of convening the Geneva conference,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the statement, issued by Aleksandr Lukashevich, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry. He also called for a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprofessional and fair investigation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAt least one photograph posted on Facebook by an activist showed what looked like a makeshift rocket. But loyalist militias and Hezbollah have both fired makeshift rockets at rebel positions in this war, and could presumably be suspects for any attacks with improvised rockets on rebel-controlled neighborhoods.\\nThe Syrian Army, in a statement read on state television, denied having used chemical weapons, calling the accusations part of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfilthy media war\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in favor of the rebels. The claims \\xe2\\x80\\x9care nothing but a desperate effort to cover their defeat on the ground, and reflect the state of hysteria, confusion and collapse of these gangs and those who support them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the statement said.\\nLouay Mekdad, a media coordinator for the military wing of the opposition Syrian National Council, said the attack showed that Mr. Assad \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdoesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care any longer about red lines since he has already exceeded too many of them while the world has showed no reaction.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMr. Mekdad called on the Security Council and international powers to \\xe2\\x80\\x9clive up to their moral and historic responsibility\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to protect civilians in Syria. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf the international community doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t move now, when is it going to move?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.' target:-1\n",

      "features:b'Maj. Nidal Hasan, accused of killing 13 soldiers at Fort Hood in 2009, said the evidence will show \\'I am the shooter.\\' The trial will be important, even if the verdict seems certain.\\nThe US Army on Tuesday began to try one of its own \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Maj. Nidal Hasan \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for his role in a deadly attack on deployment-ready soldiers at Fort Hood on Nov. 5, 2009. In his opening statement, Major Hasan, who has long sought to declare his guilt, said that \"the evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter.\"\\nHasan is accused opening fire at a training center, killing 13 and injuring scores of others. He was shot by a responding police officer, and is now partly paralyzed from that injury.\\nThough there is little suspense about the final verdict, the trial \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which could last months \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is important to the military-justice system, to the victims and their families, and to the still-unresolved question of whether the attack was an act of terrorism. The trial\\'s first day made those stakes clear.\\nThe US armed services have not carried out an execution since 1961. Eleven of 16 military death-penalty cases during the past 30 years have been overturned, leaving five soldiers at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., still awaiting execution.\\nMilitary-justice experts say Col. Tara Osborn, the presiding judge, has gone to great lengths to make sure the verdict and sentence in this trial survive any appeals. For example, in the long run up to the much-delayed trial, Hasan pleaded with the court to let him acknowledge his guilt, but Colonel Osborn, denied that request, given that the prosecution is seeking the death penalty. She\\'s also allowed Hasan to defend himself, giving him wide legal leeway.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is one case they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re absolutely determined to [not be brought down on appeal]. Since military capital punishment has been so plagued and riddled with errors, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re tyring to learn from those mistakes [with the Hasan case], and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to [try to get a conviction] pretty much how long it takes, and whatever resources they take,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d David Frakt, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh, told the Monitor earlier this summer.\\nThe scene at the readiness center was pure terror and mayhem, with unarmed soldiers trying to flee and hide behind desks and tables. Now victims face the prospect of taking the stand to explain what they saw, and then being cross-examined by man on trial for unleashing the fury of bullets against them.\\nOsborn\\'s ruling that Hasan can defend himself has been widely seen as an insult to survivors and the families of those who died. Delays in the trial have also worn on possible witnesses and the broader military community in Texas and beyond.\\nYet at least some of the 30 victims scheduled to testify say they are anxious to help convict a man they see as a traitor.\\n\"I\\'m not going to dread anything. That\\'s a sign of fear,\" injured Staff Sgt. Alonzo Lunsford told the Associated Press. \"That man strikes no fear in my heart. He strikes no fear in my family. What he did to me was bad. But the biggest mistake that he made was I survived. So he will see me again.\"\\nOn its first day, the trial shed light on the motives for the attack. Although President Obama on May 23 said that Hasan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s act may have been \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinspired by larger notions of jihad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Obama administration has defined the attack as an act of workplace violence.\\nIn his opening statement Tuesday, Hasan said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEvidence will show I was on the wrong side of America\\'s war and I later switched sides. We in the mujahideen are imperfect beings trying to establish a perfect religion.\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I apologize for any mistakes I have made in this endeavor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nOne of the prosecutors, Lt. Col. Steve Henricks, said of Hasan: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe didn\\'t want to deploy [to Afghanistan] and he came to believe he had a jihad duty to murder soldiers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hasan, Colonel Hendricks said, wanted to \"kill as many soldiers as he could.\"\\nGovernment officials say that starting in 2008 Hasan sent more than a dozen e-mails to Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical cleric whom the US killed with a drone strike in 2011.\\nIn a pretrial motion, Hasan told Osborn that he had acted in defense of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe leadership of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, the Taliban\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by targeting US soldiers ready to be deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq. But she said he could not use that defense in court. Legally, experts say, it would be impossible prove, since there was no evidence that the particular soldiers he targeted posed any direct risk to Taliban leaders.\\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.\\nThe issue is more than semantic. Victims are ineligible for some Army benefits because their injuries are not classified as \"combat related.\" Meanwhile, Hasan is still collecting a pension.\\nIf classified as a terrorist attack, the Fort Hood shootings would be the deadliest on US soil since 9/11. The shootings fit a shift in the war on terror after 9/11, in which plots attacks against the American homeland were most often carried out by self-radicalized \"lone wolves.\"' target:0\n",

Mike Mullen, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\\nTheir report was unsparing in concluding that \\xe2\\x80\\x9csystemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the State Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bureaus of diplomatic security and near eastern affairs resulted in a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csecurity posture that was inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate to deal with the attack that took place.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Clinton took responsibility for the security failures when she testified at a Congressional hearing in January.\\nWednesday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hearing, led by Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican of California who is chairman of the House oversight committee, featured three witnesses who testified about those failures. One of them, Gregory Hicks, the No. 2 official at the American Embassy in Tripoli, was at the embassy the night of the Benghazi attack. He said he was later demoted for raising questions about how the incident was handled, a charge the State Department denied.\\nThe hearing did not prove anything like an administration cover-up or other hysterical allegations of crimes equal to Watergate that some Republicans, such as Representative Steve King and Senator Lindsey Graham, have alleged. Republicans have held numerous hearings and briefings on Benghazi and are threatening to hold even more. It is a level of interest they did not show during George W. Bush\\xe2\\x80\\x99s administration when there were 64 attacks on American diplomatic targets or in the years they spent cutting back diplomatic security budgets.\\nThe real scandal is that serious follow-up on security in Libya is going unaddressed. Congress needs to make sure that State Department budgets for personnel and security improvements are sufficient and that security reforms are put in place as soon as possible.\\nThe Senate should move quickly to confirm the ambassador, Deborah Jones, whose hearing was Tuesday.\\nCongress and the Obama administration also need to pay more attention to what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening in Libya in general. After helping opposition forces oust Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the United States seems to have lost interest. That is a huge mistake as militias threaten the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s democratic transition and stability. That surely is not an outcome that Ambassador Stevens would have wanted.' target:-1\n",

For many of his supporters, preventing or delaying legal immigrants from returning to high-paid tech jobs, which they say should go to U.S.-born workers anyway, is a small price to pay for the promise of more security.\\nThe move is already roiling the tech industry, with affected employees being urged to return to the U.S. and consult with corporate immigration experts.\\nInternet Association President and CEO Michael Beckerman said the Internet industry is \"deeply concerned\" by Trump\\'s order.\\n\"While this order impacts many companies outside of the tech industry, Internet companies in particular thrive in the U.S. because the best and the brightest are able to create innovative products and services right here in America,\" Beckerman said in an emailed statement. \"While we support President Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s efforts to grow our economy and allow \\xe2\\x80\\x98people of great talent\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to come into the U.S., the executive order signed yesterday has troubling consequences.\"\\nThe ban includes green card holders who are authorized to live and work in the United States, according to a Homeland Security spokeswoman, Reuters reported. Some immigrants with legal visas trying to return to the U.S. from trips abroad were also detained, according to news reports.\\n\"The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s challenges,\" Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and an adviser to President Trump said on Twitter. \"Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the U.S. They\\'ve done right, not wrong & don\\'t deserve to be rejected.\"\\nIn a memo sent to Google employees first reported by Bloomberg News and the Wall Street Journal, Pichai said one employee was rushing back from a trip to New Zealand before the order was assigned, while two others were grappling with what this might mean to their families.\\nA similar situation was playing out at other tech companies.\\nMicrosoft said it\\'s providing legal advice and assistance to its employees affected by the executive order.\\n\"We share the concerns about the impact of the executive order on our employees from the listed countries, all of whom have been in the United States lawfully,\" the tech giant said in a statement.\\nAccording to Microsoft\\'s general counsel Brad Smith, 76 Microsoft employees are citizens with a U.S. visa from the affected countries.\\n\"We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already contacted everyone in this group,\" he told employees in a memo. \"But there may be other employees from these countries who have U.S. green cards rather than a visa who may be affected, and there may be family members from these countries that we haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t yet reached.\"\\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a LinkedIn post that his company would \"continue to advocate on this important topic.\"\\n\"As an immigrant and as a CEO, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world,\" Nadella said.\\nUber CEO Travis Kalanick told employees he would raise the immigration ban on Friday when he takes part in President Trump\\'s first business advisory group meeting.\\n\"While every government has their own immigration controls, allowing people from all around the world to come here and make America their home has largely been the U.S.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s policy since its founding. That means this ban will impact many innocent people,\" Kalanick said.\\nApple CEO Tim Cook was in Washington, D.C., where he has been meeting with GOP lawmakers and with Trump\\'s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner.\\nIn a memo to employees, he said \"it is not a policy we support.\"\\n\"In my conversations with officials here in Washington this week, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made it clear that Apple believes deeply in the importance of immigration \\xe2\\x80\\x94 both to our company and to our nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s future. Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do,\" Cook wrote, according to a memo sent to employees worldwide and obtained by USA TODAY. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian immigrant.\\nFor Box CEO Aaron Levie, the Trump order also hit home. One of the founders of the cloud-based storage and services company is Iranian-American and Box is currently trying to assess how many of its employees are affected.\\n\"At the corporate level, we are trying to take inventory on who could be impacted and ensuring that they stay within the country for now,\" Levie said. \"We are really just getting a handle on the legal side of the situation, what we can fight and ultimately how we protect employees in the process.\"\\nMore broadly, the order sends \"the wrong moral message to the world and within our own country,\" Levie said, turning away refugees and doing nothing to make Americans safer. \"It\\'s very unfortunate and very disappointing,\" he said.\\nSlack CEO Stewart Butterfield also condemned the immigration ban.\\n\"Immigration is unambiguously an economic benefit, but, doesn\\'t matter: do the right thing because it\\'s right,\" he wrote in a series of posts on Twitter. \"My grandfather came from Poland between the wars, at 17, sponsored by an elder sister. Two more siblings made it. Everyone else died.\"\\nTechnology investor Chris Sacca pledged to match donations to the American Civil Liberties Union up to $25,000 and then quickly raised it to $50,000. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, say they have either filed lawsuits or will do so shortly challenging the ban.\\n\"The @aclu took Trump to court. Let\\'s stand with them,\" he tweeted.\\nWith protests spreading to airports on Saturday, Sam Altman, president of Silicon Valley tech incubator Y Combinator, urged the tech industry to speak up.\\n\"It is time for tech companies to start speaking up about some of the actions taken by President Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s administration,\" Altman said in a blog post. \"The tech community is powerful.

Although there is some business risk in doing so, there is strength in numbers\\xe2\\x80\\x94if everyone does it early this coming week, we will all make each other stronger.\"\\nImmigrants account for a significant part of the workforce in the tech industry, which has for years advocated loosening laws to increase the flow of skilled immigrants into the U.S. With its heavy reliance on the H-1B visa program that allows software engineers and other skilled workers to work in the U.S., Silicon Valley fears what immigration restrictions will come from the Trump administration.\\nTrump\\'s perspective on immigrants, and Muslims in particular, has caused tensions between the White House and Silicon Valley. Tech executives and workers have denounced the president\\'s anti-Muslim views and some have pledged not to help build Trump\\'s proposed Muslim registry.\\nOn Saturday, Chesky pushed back against Trump\\'s executive order in a tweet. \"Open doors brings all of U.S. together. Closing doors further divides U.S.,\" he wrote. \"Let\\'s all find ways to connect people, not separate them.\"\\nIn a Facebook post, he offered free housing, even providing his personal email address. \"We have 3M homes, so we can definitely find people a place to stay,\" he write.\\nSome in Silicon Valley have direct ties to the Trump administration.

      "features:b'WASHINGTON -- Overcoming reservations from the left, the right and the American public, a Senate committee Wednesday passed a resolution to bomb Syria in retaliation for President Bashar Assad\\'s alleged use of chemical weapons.\\nIn a delayed markup of a resolution to authorize the use of military force, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 10 to 7, with one present, to let President Barack Obama mount a bombing campaign aimed at the Syrian regime\\'s weapons of mass destruction for up to 90 days, albeit within a more limited scope than Obama had requested. Specifically, the committee included language that would prohibit the use of U.S. troops on the ground \"for the purpose of combat operations.\"\\nCommittee Chairman Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), ranking member Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), John McCain (R-Ariz.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.) voted for the resolution.\\nSens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), James Risch (R-Idaho), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) voted against the authorization, while Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) voted present.\\nThe committee also voted 14-5 to table an amendment from Paul that would clarify the president\\'s constitutional authority to use military force in the event that Congress voted against intervention in Syria. Paul\\'s amendment would include language in the resolution to specify that if the authorization failed to pass Congress, the president \"would be in violation of the Constitution\" if he ordered a military strike against the Syrian government anyway.\\nIn arguing for his amendment, Paul said that his fellow lawmakers should dispense with the Obama administration\\'s claim that such an action would be short of war. \"This will indeed be a war,\" he said.\\nRubio, Flake, McCain and Barrasso all voted to table Paul\\'s amendment.\\nMcCain, long a proponent of intervention in Syria\\'s two-year civil war, demanded -- and won -- an amendment that said the U.S. aim was to change the momentum in the war in favor of the rebels.\\nThe Senate resolution crafted by Menendez and Corker specifies that it is directed at weapons of mass destruction, seeking to deter their further use and to \"degrade\" Syria\\'s ability to use them. McCain told reporters before the vote that he believed \"in the strongest terms\" that a provision must be included that would help create conditions for Assad\\'s departure. The senator thus moved closer to calling for the sort of drive to affect regime change that some libertarians and liberals oppose.\\n\"When Bashar Assad remains in an advantageous position, he will never leave Syria. He has to know that he is losing,\" McCain said. \"There is no policy without that, and there is no strategy without that, except for significant attacking of facilities that deliver chemical weapons against the Free Syrian Army.\"\\nMcCain added that both Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry have said they favor changing the momentum on the ground in Syria. \"So I don\\'t know why they should be resistant to that being a sense of purpose embodied in the legislation,\" he said.\\nUdall offered an amendment that would only authorize naval and air base military strikes outside Syrian territory or airspace \"as the president determines to be necessary and appropriate.\" He said the measure would ensure that the U.S. role remained limited and not leave room for an open-ended \"bombing campaign.\"\\nThe amendment failed 17-1, as other members of the committee argued it would \"tie the president\\'s hands\" by placing too many restrictions on his ability to act effectively.\\n\"This is micromanagement that frankly is not only unnecessary, but we really can\\'t tell the president of the United States what tactics he has to employ,\" McCain said.\\nThe Senate resolution that passed the committee calls for the White House to present a plan within 30 days of the resolution\\'s enactment. It gives Obama 60 days to act, with the option of extending the action for another 30 days. Congress can disapprove of the extension.\\nBefore senators worked out their compromises, they attended a classified briefing Wednesday morning with Kerry and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel that ended up running nearly four hours.\\nAlso speaking before the vote, Corker had said there was \"some degree of flexibility\" for additions to the draft resolution, though he declined to offer specifics on which amendments would be considered. The committee\\'s top Republican conceded that it was tough to bring lawmakers together in support of military action that was both narrow and broad enough to address everyone\\'s concerns, but added that it was \"not a fair assessment\" to suggest the committee didn\\'t have the votes to continue.\\nPaul told reporters that he didn\\'t see a \"clear-cut or compelling American interest\" to justify taking action in Syria -- though during the markup hearing, he denied reports that he was going to filibuster the resolution on the Senate floor.\\n\"I see a horrible tragedy, but I don\\'t see that our involvement will lessen the tragedy,\" Paul, one of the most vocal opponents of Syria intervention, said after the classified briefing.\\nHe nonetheless acknowledged that the resolution would likely be approved by the full Senate. \"The only chance of stopping what I consider to be bad policy will be in the House,\" Paul said.\\nThe House Foreign Affairs Committee held its own hearing with Kerry and Hagel on Wednesday.

      "features:b'Nelson Mandela was always mindful that his leadership role in the liberation of South Africa from apartheid might not have been possible if he had not been imprisoned.\\n\"It is possible that if I had not gone to jail and been able to read and listen to the stories of many people. ... I might not have learned these things,\" Mandela said of the insights that he gained during his 27 years in jail.\\nIn an interview less than a year after he had stepped down as the country\\'s first black president, Mandela shared with me reflections of how prison changed him.\\nHe said that reading the biographies of great leaders who had been able to overcome their shortcomings and rise to do great things had inspired him. He said it also helped him to realize that behind every seemingly ordinary person lay the potential of greatness.\\n\"I have been surprised a great deal sometimes when I see somebody who looks less than ordinary, but when you talk to the person and they open their mouths, they are something completely different,\" he said.\\nMandela said that prison gave him time to think about the times when he had failed to acknowledge people who had been kind to him.\\nMandela said that at the height of the struggle against apartheid, he and other leaders were understandably angry at the humiliation and loss of dignity of those who suffered under the unjust policy. It meant their actions were driven by anger and emotion rather than by reflection and consultation.\\n\"But in jail -- especially for those who stayed in single cells -- you had enough opportunity to sit down and think,\" he said.\\nThere was time to listen to the stories of people who were highly educated and who were widely traveled and experienced. \"When they told of their experiences, you felt humbled,\" he said.\\nMandela said that he had learned that when you had the moral high ground, it was better to sit down and talk to people and persuade them of the correctness of your cause.\\n\"If you have an objective in life, then you want to concentrate on that and not engage in infighting with your enemies,\" he said. \"You want to create an atmosphere where you can move everybody toward the goal you have set for yourself,\" Mandela said.\\nNelson Mandela: A man of many handshakes\\nIn his twilight, Mandela was at pains to publish and acknowledge his weaknesses and shortcomings in his family life, in his relationships with women and his first wife, Evelyn. He was keen to dispel any notion of sainthood that might be bestowed on him.\\nHe also spoke increasingly about the importance of changing oneself.\\n\"One of the most difficult things is not to change society -- but to change yourself,\" Mandela said in 1999 at a tribute to billionaire businessman Douw Steyn who had made his Johannesburg residence available to Mandela as a retreat after his prison release in 1990.\\nMandela had given similar advice to wife Winnie in a letter written to her in 1981 after she had been jailed by the apartheid regime. Mandela noted that there were qualities \"in each one of us\" that form the basis of our spiritual life and that we can change ourselves by observing our reactions to the unfolding of life.\\nTen years later, Mandela said that it gave him a feeling of fulfillment to see that Douw Steyn had changed and had learned to share his resources with the poor.\\n\"It enables me to go to bed with an enriching feeling in my soul and the belief that I am changing myself\" by reconciling with former adversaries, Mandela said.\\nI believe that the essence of Mandela\\'s greatness was to change himself fundamentally during his period in jail and emerge as a potent leader and example for all humanity.\\nOpinion: Nelson Mandela saved my life\\nThe reflections took me back to the extraordinary day of Mandela\\'s release. The day the legend became a man. Even now, the moment seems frozen in time.\\nIt was February 11, 1990, and the African sun shone from a clear blue sky on a windless summer\\'s day in Cape Town. About an hour\\'s drive from the city, the international media thronged around the entrance of a neat prison warder\\'s house to await the emergence of one of the century\\'s most iconic figures.\\nI had arrived late at the prison and wandered unnoticed into the prison grounds where my slate-blue cotton suit coincidentally blended in with the uniform color of the South African police. That might have had something to do with the fact that I was not challenged when I strode confidently into the prison grounds. But to this day I do not know.\\nAn unscheduled wait of an hour while Mandela consulted an anti-apartheid delegation including his wife Winnie, who had arrived an hour late, seemed like an eternity.\\nWhen Mandela, flanked by Winnie, finally emerged walking down the driveway towards the prison premise gates, I lost all sense of time and self and strode towards Mandela to shake his hand and congratulate him on his freedom.\\nHe recognized me from the photograph that accompanied my regular column I had written for the Cape Times, where I often analyzed the successes and setbacks of the anti-apartheid movement and the African National Congress in exile.\\nHis face broke into a broad smile as we shook hands and he continued his historic walk to freedom.\\nAt the time, I was the southern Africa correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor which was for many years the only international news publication that Mandela was allowed to read in jail albeit in a vetted form with pages and sections frequently removed.\\nOn his first visit to the United States in 1990, Mandela broke from his official program on Sunday, June 24 to pay an unscheduled visit to the headquarters of the Monitor at One Norway Street in Boston to the astonishment of the editor and staff. (Today the Monitor is online only. The newspaper ceased daily publication in 2009.)\\nSouth Africa since apartheid: Boom or bust?\\nI received an incredulous call from my foreign editor, Jane Lampman, on that Sunday asking me if I could guess who was standing outside the building with two bodyguards asking to see the editor. It was, she said, Nelson Mandela. I was astonished too.\\nMandela was intrigued that the founder of the newspaper, Mary Baker Eddy, also founded a religion. Mandela came to respect the Monitor\\'s sustained and fair coverage of South Africa during his time in jail.\\nTo this day, Mandela\\'s weaknesses, his turbulent youth and his sometimes tempestuous relationships with women can still detract from the iconic status that Mandela achieved in his own lifetime.\\nBut, the responsible airing of his weaknesses -- including his own acknowledgment -- in fact humanized Mandela and focused on his extraordinary strength of character and commitment in overcoming both his weaknesses and adversity in his own lifetime. It augmented Mandela\\'s greatness.\\nCarrying on the work of Nelson Mandela\\nIt is Mandela\\'s achievement as a universal icon that has always fascinated me most. He first conquered his jailers by convincing them that they were the ones imprisoned by their own unsustainable policies based on fear and racial injustice. And then he negotiated them out of power with the sheer force of his moral authority and belief in himself.\\nMandela\\'s example and actions in becoming the country\\'s first black president struck a mortal blow to racism worldwide and helped build confidence and pave the way for Barack Obama to pull off a similar feat in the United States.\\nIf Mandela has a global heir in the ongoing campaign against racism and the quest for human dignity it has to be Barack Hussein Obama.\\nThe power of Mandela\\'s leadership was rooted in the fact that at key moments in his life he acted independently of the movement to which he dedicated his life and to which he deferred as a \"loyal and obedient\" member.\\nHe did so when he decided in 1986 to begin negotiating with his jailers from behind bars not knowing where it would end. He did so in continuing to refer to former President F. W. de Klerk as a \"man of integrity\" long after it was less popular to do so in the ranks of the African National Congress.\\nAnd he did so again when he went out on a limb within his own constituency after his release to support the overwhelmingly white South African rugby team in the World Cup in 1995.\\nMandela said that even if he wanted to he could not bind future generations to remember history in a particular way.\\nThe lesson of Mandela\\'s life is that he has no need to bind anyone to his legacy nor does he need any organization to do so.\\nHis actions in his own lifetime are his legacy and they will remain indelibly etched in history for generations to come as a living example to inspire the leaders of tomorrow.\\nFollow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.\\nJoin us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.' target:-1\n",

Mr. Reid and the senators who have been the most vocal on stopping the Republican blockade of White House nominees are now confident they have the votes to make the change.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not bluffing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one senior aide who has spoken with Mr. Reid directly and expects a vote on Thursday, barring any unforeseen breakthrough on blocked judges.\\nThe threat that Democrats could significantly limit how the filibuster can be used against nominees has rattled Republicans. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who has brokered last-minute deals that have averted a change to filibuster rules in the past, visited Mr. Reid in his office on Thursday but failed to strike a compromise.\\nSenator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa took to the Senate floor and denounced Democrats, saying that if they changed the rules, Republicans would consider them applicable to all judicial nominees, including those for the Supreme Court. Mr. Reid has said he supports keeping intact the minority party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to filibuster controversial Supreme Court nominees.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cApparently the other side wants to change the rules while still preserving the ability to block a Republican president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to replace a liberal Supreme Court Justice with an originalist,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Grassley said.\\nSenate Democrats appear ready to take a step that members of each party have threatened for the better part of a decade, but have not taken, in part because of the political disruption it would create. But senators know this year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s majority could be tomorrow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s minority, yearning for the filibuster as a weapon.\\nThe problem, as Democrats see it, is that Republicans have effectively rewritten Senate rules to create a supermajority requirement for confirming presidential nominees. Filibustering cabinet-level officials, once extremely rare, is now routine.\\nWhile Democrats filibustered their share of judicial nominees when they were in the minority under President George W. Bush, including people named to the powerful District of Columbia appeals court, what Republicans say they intend to accomplish goes beyond simply blocking a vote. Their goal is to reshape the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most powerful appeals court by shrinking it to just eight full-time judges. By law it has 11 judges who regularly hear cases.\\nDemocrats said that was a step too far. The court is split with four judges appointed by Democrats and four by Republicans. But among the six semiretired judges who still hear cases, five are seen as conservative, one as liberal.\\nDemocrats got a reminder of how conservatively the court tends to lean when Judge Janice Rogers Brown, a Bush appointee, wrote an opinion last month declaring that the Affordable Care Act\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mandate that employers provide free coverage for contraception was an infringement of individual religious liberty.\\nFor Democrats who were on the fence about backing a filibuster change, like Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer of California, this was a final straw. Judge Brown was among the judges that seven Democrats and seven Republicans agreed to confirm in a deal that kept Republicans from exercising their nuclear option threat in 2005.' target:-1\n",

      "features:b'NBC News is reporting U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state.\\nEnvironmental groups widely condemned the selection of Tillerson as secretary of state. Exxon is facing multiple lawsuits over its role in covering up the science behind climate change. In 2015, InsideClimate News revealed how ExxonMobil\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own research confirmed the role of fossil fuels in global warming decades ago. By 1977, Exxon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own senior experts had begun to warn the burning of fossil fuels could pose a threat to humanity. At first, Exxon launched an ambitious research program, outfitting a supertanker with instruments to study carbon dioxide in the air and ocean. But toward the end of the 1980s, Exxon changed course and shifted to the forefront of climate change denial. Since the 1990s, it has spent millions of dollars funding efforts to reject the science its own experts knew of decades ago.\\nTillerson has served as CEO and chairman of Exxon since 2006 and is known to have close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Wall Street Journal reports Tillerson has \\xe2\\x80\\x9cknown Mr. Putin since he represented Exxon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interests in Russia during the regime of Boris Yeltsin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In 2013, Putin awarded Tillerson the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Order of Friendship decoration.\\nThe news of Tillerson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s selection comes a day after President Obama ordered a review of Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role influencing the presidential election. The CIA has reportedly already concluded Russia intervened in the election to help Trump win.\\n350.org Executive Director May Boeve issued the following statement: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is unfathomable. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let Trump put the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest oil company in charge of our international climate policy. Tillerson may be a friend of Putin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, but he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no friend of the planet. ExxonMobil is still a leading funder of climate denial and is pursuing a business plan that will destroy our future. Tillerson deserves a federal investigation, not federal office. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be pressuring Senators to turn the confirmation process into a hearing on ExxonMobil\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history of climate deception. If Exxon is found guilty of working with other oil companies to deceive the public and their shareholders about the threat of climate change, they could be on the hook for fraud and racketeering charges. It would be the largest corporate scandal in history and could not only stop Tillerson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appointment, but take down the entire company.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nGreenpeace USA spokesperson Cassady Craighill said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust when we thought Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Cabinet could not get farther away from the needs of the American people, he sneaks in a Saturday appointment of Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state.

      "features:b'In a Manhattan Fox News studio on a recent Tuesday in February, Shepard Smith sits ready to begin taping his 3 p.m. newscast. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spent the preceding hour typing out edits to his script with slightly hunched posture, raising his eyebrows at his keyboard and reading his monologue to himself to test its accuracy and its cadence. The computers behind him\\xe2\\x80\\x94clad in giant white shells, they look like robots from the Star Wars universe\\xe2\\x80\\x94are each manned by researchers. Several of them are scanning their email and news sites, one is looking at @realdonaldtrump on Twitter. And Smith, wired with an earpiece to the control room, is periodically issuing commands\\xe2\\x80\\x94to those researchers, to the producers who call his desk phone, to the air around him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe need to get a statement from Israeli police,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he says, looking to bulk up a wire report about Benjamin Netanyahu. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give the Jerusalem bureau something to do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWhen the countdown to Smith\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hour of airtime arrives at 2:59, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just a number. Smith silently sits at his anchor chair, watching White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders field questions from reporters in what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s become a near-daily occurrence: his show is getting pre-empted by the most popular political drama in America. He scrolls through his phone, then leans forward on his elbows ready for Sanders to wrap. When she does, he kicks off his show a few minutes late with discussion of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbrand-new timeline\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sanders offered for the scandal of the day. Much of his script now useless, Smith does the work of writing and editing as he speaks.\\nThe president has scrambled the day-to-day lives of everyone in the news business, not least of which those at the network with which Donald Trump begins every morning. As Fox has tacked further to the right in its opinion programming, Smith\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role has at times seemed like a challenge. Being the old-fashioned anchorman and reporter at a network known for new-fashioned provocation and opinion may be the hardest job at Fox News, and one Smith mused about walking away from over the course of two interviews this winter. On March 15, the network announced Smith would stay and that he had signed a multiyear contract renewal. Which means Smith is going to have many more chances to tell viewers what they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to hear.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can remember a time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the 54-year-old anchor says after taping has wrapped at 4 p.m., \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhen we would do a rundown in the morning and, probably, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what would happen.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Those around him are feeling the Trump era as well. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m tired,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Kim Rosenberg, the network\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vice-president of news and Smith\\xe2\\x80\\x99s producer and friend. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe news cycle goes through many evolutions during the day. Trump will tweet or they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll add a news conference or the White House briefing will be pushed back three times, and the news cycle changes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nNow, his show is often eaten into by the White House\\xe2\\x80\\x99s televised press briefings. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEven now, it still boggles my mind that the next time Sarah Huckabee Sanders is on, over a year into a presidency, that it is something that all three networks will take live,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Jay Wallace, the network\\xe2\\x80\\x99s president of news since 2017 and Smith\\xe2\\x80\\x99s former executive producer. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unheard-of.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Having hustled in his early career and established his bona fides as an anchor after that, Smith would seem to be at a point where he could enjoy the status, visibility, and routine schedule a marquee anchor enjoys. Instead, Sanders, and her boss, have created a climate of uncertainty that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forced Smith to improvise.\\nSmith, a Mississippi native who retains the lilt and the flattened sentence endings of rural hometown Holly Springs, began his career as a local news-affiliate reporter in Florida. He joined Fox News at its founding in 1996 and eventually came to have both daytime and evening broadcasts. In 1999, he launched The Fox Report, the network\\xe2\\x80\\x99s flagship newscast and its version of what the broadcast networks do at 6:30 p.m. Smith became Fox\\xe2\\x80\\x99s closest analogue to the classic voice-of-God newsman. In 2013, the evening show was cancelled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere used to be a thought that, hey, we need a nightly newscast later in the day,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Wallace. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThose patterns have changed, just with the way we consume media.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Now Fox\\xe2\\x80\\x99s night-time slate is dominated by opinion\\xe2\\x80\\x94the fire-breathing sort practiced by Tucker Carlson at eight, Sean Hannity at nine, and Laura Ingraham at ten.\\nTheir coexistence with Smith is increasingly uneasy. In November 2017, Smith briskly and effectively debunked the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUranium One\\xe2\\x80\\x9d conspiracy theory, a particular bugbear of Hannity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. Reporting live on the air in the hours after the February school shooting in Parkland, Fla., Smith read a list of schools that had endured fatal gun violence since Columbine. And this month, Smith said on-air that the president, who\\xe2\\x80\\x99d called for raising the age limit for buying firearms, had caved under political pressure: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe president told the kids at Parkland, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go strong on this, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll work on this age thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Smith said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd then he met with the NRA.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Smith\\xe2\\x80\\x99s treatment of these stories\\xe2\\x80\\x94and how that treatment differs from his opinion-host colleagues\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x94hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t gone unnoticed. Hannity, who wove the Uranium One scandal into his ongoing saga of Hillary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mendacity, has called Smith \\xe2\\x80\\x9cso anti-Trump.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSmith says he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unbothered by the divergence between his reporting and Fox\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinion slate. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe serve different masters. We work for different reporting chains, we have different rules. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really have rules on the opinion side. They can say whatever they want. If it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s their opinion. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really watch a lot of opinion programming. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m busy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He laughs, enigmatic punctuation that may indicate he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been trying for a bon mot, or might just be a Mississippi-nice way of indicating he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s said what he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to say, bless my heart.\\nBut Smith isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t kidding when he says he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s busy. He has his hour and leads the unit of 17 staffers that breaks into coverage when major news occurs. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the person Fox News viewers see during a hurricane, or a school shooting. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been telling people about what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening for a long, long, long time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Smith says. He takes a long and considered pause. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know that when something big happens, people turn to us. I think people always will. People who maybe aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t with us all the time who aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t regular watchers, maybe there is some sort of confusion about what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinion and what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s news, but I think our audience understands the difference and comes to us when they need us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nUnlike some portion of the audience that reflexively switches on Fox News, Smith is disengaged by politics. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI get it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he says, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat some of our opinion programming is there strictly to be entertaining. I get that. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work there. I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work there. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to sit around and yell at each other and talk about your philosophy and my philosophy. That sounds horrible to me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He cites his values growing up: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about your money, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about your politics, and you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about your sex. Right now, everyone wants to talk about those things, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not one of them. Not going to do it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThis becomes clear in our first meeting when I broach his personal life; Smith, who\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been dogged by rumors for much of his career, publicly acknowledged he is gay in 2017. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the part you like,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he shoots back when I ask if his boyfriend of six years works in the news business. Some of the honey drips away from his drawl. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind talking about it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just, you know, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just my personal life. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not hiding anything. I have a longtime boyfriend and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re as happy as we can be and we live a very normal life and go to dinner and go to games and see his family and see my family. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great for us. But I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t imagine anyone else finding it interesting.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSmith isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the only anchor to profess a desire to avoid becoming the story, but his commitment to facts over feeling makes him an unusual fit for an era defined by news personalities. His opinion colleagues, geared to thrive in contentious times, fit the tenor of the moment more naturally. That he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, to some portion of the Fox audience, become despised for telling them what they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to hear is a frustrating part of the job. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt depends on what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you looking for news and information so that you can make decisions about your life and your family? Or are you looking for your worldview to be confirmed? For that second kind of viewer, when the facts fly in the face of your worldview, that can be unsettling. Sometimes, then, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like me. And there are other times when the facts work beautifully with their worldview. Then, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re very happy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nFrom its earliest days, Fox News has dazzled with its commitment to showmanship, from glimmering studios to vervy transitions between stories to well-put-together anchors (a role the trim, tan and neatly groomed Smith fits into tidily). Wallace sees the network\\xe2\\x80\\x99s main competition as the entertainment industry. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople may turn on the network and get pissed at whoever\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on, but the storytelling that we have and the way that we break stories down is so important and compelling, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd when they do leave, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re probably going to turn on Netflix.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWhat doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t show onscreen is just how much has changed since 2016. The late Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes was forced to resign in July of that year for an alleged pattern of sexual assault in the workplace. (He died in 2017.) Smith describes that period as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe hardest time in my professional life. We were in Cleveland at the [Republican] Convention as our professional world was collapsing around us. We had become the news.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The newsroom where researchers, reporters, and digital staff work was recently renovated with substantial input from 21st Century Fox and Fox News Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch. Completed only weeks before I visit, the revamp created an open office. The clear sightlines, with busy young reporters tapping away under various illuminated screens, is a powerful reminder of just what came before. Fox and other TV outlets were closed-door environments in which secrets could fester.\\nFox News has been forced to grapple with systemic changes outside its doors, too. The network, which long prized a reputation earned in the Clinton era as a brash insurgent, is now the primary newsfeed for the President. Smith doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know or profess to care if Trump watches his reporting. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have no idea. I hope not, I hope he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s busy. The president says he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have much time for television, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard him say that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we know Trump watches Fox\\xe2\\x80\\x99s morning opinion broadcast? \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know that he watches Fox & Friends in the morning, because he often tweets about it. But those aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the things I concern myself with. I try to find out what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening, as opposed to just listening to what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re saying.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Smith also shuts out the ascendant voices that have recently outflanked Fox\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinion journalists on the right: Does he read the website Breitbart or listen to provocateur Alex Jones? \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNope,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he says.\\nBut many of the viewers he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trying to reach do. And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not shy about their disapproval when Smith calls out a fiction. On my second visit to Smith\\xe2\\x80\\x99s studio, he alludes to this feedback: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWait \\xe2\\x80\\x98til you see your reader email after this piece.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He leaves his show\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Twitter account to his team, but says he is aware of how strongly voiced the critiques are.\\nDespite being the cable-news ratings leader, Fox News\\xe2\\x80\\x99 audience is also old. The median Fox News viewer in 2017 was 65 overall, the same as MSNBC, and 66 in primetime, the highest of all cable news networks. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think that our audience skews conservative. We learn about our audience through research and data,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Smith. A 2014 study by Pew Research Center indicated Fox News was the most-trusted news source for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconsistently conservative\\xe2\\x80\\x9d viewers, edging out the Wall Street Journal, Breitbart, and the Drudge Report.\\nSmith\\xe2\\x80\\x99s generally straight-news broadcast doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t frequently upset those viewers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 senses of self. But breaking news has a way of shaking up established agendas. The day after my first visit was the day of the school shooting in Parkland, Fl. News of the incident broke as Smith was preparing to go to air. Once again, the pace of events scrambled a plan that was already pretty seat-of-pants. Smith took to the air for three hours, during which he listed the shootings and asked, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they put the best and the brightest together to research it and figure it out and help us stop it? [We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re] failing our children.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe question resonated in part because Smith was, at that moment, the voice most widely heard. Perpetually ahead in the ratings, he was being watched by 3.3 million viewers in the 5 p.m. hour, compared to just under 1.6 million watching Wolf Blitzer on CNN. Smith\\xe2\\x80\\x99s critics, he says, told him that reading the list of schools was \\xe2\\x80\\x9c political. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making this political.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Smith denies the charge: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI guess, I know, that there are people who come at everything in a political way. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never really liked politics. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always said that I thought politics in America was weird and creepy, and lacked a connection to reality.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nOn our first meeting, Smith had been energized: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more challenging,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he says of reporting during the Trump presidency, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand more challenging is more fun.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d On our second, he seemed depleted. Bringing up walking away from the news desk was less an idle threat and more of a contingency plan for coping with a different America. Describing the response he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s received lately, Smith says \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif we start making changes, if ratings go down or viewers scream too much and we make changes to accommodate, we are in extreme dereliction of duty. I cannot do it. I will not do it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll quit. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll stop doing it completely.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decided to stay in some part because the times are so precarious. In his telling, before he signed his new contract, he was nervous about what would come on Fox\\xe2\\x80\\x99s air after he left. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo stop doing it would be bad because I think that there is a need for it and I know the degree to which we care about it and focus on it and we want it to be as perfect as it can be. And I wonder, if I stopped delivering the facts, what would go in its place in this place that is most watched, most listened, most viewed, most trusted? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nOn Smith\\xe2\\x80\\x99s primetime show, he used to do light stories from time to time. Wallace, the head of Fox News, noted that Smith is a weather obsessive: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe were somewhere in L.A. and he told me some weird fact that there are 19 weather zones within two blocks in West Hollywood, and I was like, why do you know that worthless knowledge?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Asked to name one of Smith\\xe2\\x80\\x99s favorite stories, his executive producer Jon Glenn recalls the 2015 incident in which two llamas ran through suburban Phoenix. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all going through this whole long journey of politics,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Glenn says, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut look, there are some freaking llamas running down the street in Arizona!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSmith remembers this fondly too. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe would try to be entertaining with them, because I always felt like you should get some dessert with the meal. That seems like an eternity ago.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The people tuning into Fox and writing him emails and tweets don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want dessert in the form of a cute story. More and more, they seem to crave red meat, an appetite that much on Fox News\\xe2\\x80\\x99 air has helped to nurture. But Smith can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t brook shifting his reporting. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think we have to make the wall between news and opinion as high and as thick and as impenetrable as possible.

      "features:b'Updated at 2:58 p.m. ET on 7/30\\n(CNN) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 A new plan from President Barack Obama that would alter the corporate tax code while investing in job creation is a deal that any \"serious\" lawmaker could sign onto, the president argued in Tennessee Tuesday.\\nWhat Obama called a \"grand bargain\" is being proposed in a bid to break partisan gridlock currently plaguing attempts to pass major legislation in Washington, though congressional Republicans signaled on Tuesday they were unlikely to back the plan, which the president announced at an Amazon.com distribution center in Chattanooga.\\n\"Here\\'s the bottom line: If folks in Washington really want a \\'grand bargain,\\' how about a grand bargain for middle-class jobs?\" Obama said in his fourth speech in a week centered on the economy. \"I don\\'t want to go through the same old arguments, where I propose an idea and Republicans say no just because it\\'s my idea. So I\\'m going to try offering something that serious people in both parties should be able to support.\"\\nObama suggested Congress cut corporate tax rates - long a goal of Republicans - while simultaneously making investments in job creation programs, which Democrats and the president have been championing.\\nIn the past, both Obama and Republicans have insisted that corporate tax reform be passed alongside reform for individual earners. Republicans argue that some small business owners file taxes as individuals, and would only benefit from an overhaul of the entire tax code.\\nThe president\\'s plan would propose slashing the corporate tax rate to 28% from 35% while making the filing process simpler and ramping up incentives for small businesses to hire workers.\\nThe plan would also put the tax rate on manufacturers at 25% and remove current tax incentives to send jobs overseas.\\nOn Tuesday, Obama explained that he\\'s open to changing only the corporate tax code as long as it\\'s combined with major investments in programs that create high-paying middle class jobs.\\n\"If we\\'re going to give businesses a better deal, we\\'re also going to have to give workers a better deal, too,\" he said, suggesting money saved by closing tax loopholes should be put toward infrastructure initiatives that would create construction jobs.\\nObama also called for bolstering the country\\'s manufacturing sector and network of community colleges, and proposed creating 45 \"innovation institutes\" that pair companies with universities and community colleges with the goal of fostering research and development.\\nEarly reaction from Republicans to the outlines of the president\\'s plan was not receptive.\\n\"While I understand he is looking for headlines here, reports indicate that the policy he intends to announce doesn\\'t exactly qualify as news,\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor Tuesday. \"It is just a further left version of a widely panned plan he already proposed two years ago, this time with extra goodies for tax-and-spend liberals.\"\\nMcConnell said he first learned of the plan Monday night. Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, wrote on Twitter his office learned of the proposed \"grand bargain\" through media reports, though White House officials said they reached out to a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Monday to discuss the proposal.\\nMichael Steel, another spokesman for Boehner, cast the proposal as old news.\\n\"The President has always supported corporate tax reform,\" Steel wrote in a statement. \"Republicans want to help families and small businesses, too. This proposal allows President Obama to support President Obama\\'s position on taxes and President Obama\\'s position on spending, while leaving small businesses and American families behind.\"\\nAnother House Republican leadership aide said the White House was taking their own plan and making it less amenable to Republicans than previous offers, while \"trying to extract a ransom of infrastructure spending\" at the same time.\\nThe aide argued the new White House plan was an attempt to \"get a headline that says they\\'re offering a grand bargain.\"\\nObama\\'s address in Chattanooga is the latest in a series of speeches the president will deliver on the economy and jobs, part of an attempt to turn back to the issue that rates as most important among Americans. The tour began last week in Illinois, Missouri and Florida.\\nTuesday\\'s announcement of a \"grand bargain\" was the first specific proposal the president made in his new push to focus on the economy, though White House officials say there will be more as the initiative continues.\\nDuring his remarks, Obama said he\\'d \"keep throwing things out there to see if something takes\" on jobs.\\n\"If (Republicans) have better ideas to help create jobs rebuilding our infrastructure, or help workers earn the high-tech skills our businesses demand, let\\'s hear \\'em,\" the president said.\\nAmazon.com, whose facility Obama spoke at Tuesday, announced this week plans to hire 7,000 workers for its U.S. operation, with most jobs offering pay and benefits far above typical retail wages, the company said.\\nAmazon did not give specific pay scales for the positions, but said the 5,000 warehouse jobs will pay 30% more than jobs in traditional retail stores.\\nThe jobs are full-time permanent positions and also include stock grants that, over the last five years, have averaged 9% of pay for Amazon\\'s full-time workers. And the company said many workers would also be eligible for 95% tuition reimbursement for those attending college, whether or not their field of study is related to their job.\\nIn addition, Amazon is looking for 2,000 workers for its customer service department, with those jobs being a mix of full-time, part-time and seasonal positions.\\nCNN\\'s Brianna Keilar, Chris Isidore and Adam Aigner-Treworgy contributed to this report.' target:-1\n",

This new right is so powerful it has completely wiped out the old rights that our founding fathers enshrined in our Constitution: freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of association.\\nBut we saw in the first column, same sex marriage is not really a right but a preference. Some call it a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cright\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but they are actually stealing the authority of rights from God and misapplying it to sexual behavior. They have invented a new moral \\xe2\\x80\\x9cright\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and are attempting to legislate acceptance of it on everyone else (actually, they are trying to have their new morality imposed by liberal judges).\\nNow, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t legislate morality.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The truth is, all laws legislate morality. Morality is about right and wrong and all laws declare in a legal sense one behavior right and the opposite behavior wrong. So the question is not whether we can legislate morality, but \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhose morality will we legislate?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMany don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t realize this because they lump morality and religion together. But laws can and do legislate morality without legislating religion. Few people in the political process are trying to tell others what church to go to or what religious rituals to observe. That would be legislating religion. But everyone is trying to tell others how to treat one another. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legislating morality. While religions may teach that people have certain moral rights (like a right to life or property), you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to be religious to know those rights or to support them. You need God to justify them, but not to legislate them.\\nCARTOONS | AF Branco\\nView Cartoon\\nLiberals can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t justify why same-sex marriage is right. Nevertheless, they want to legislate it as a right and will convict you of heresy if you fail to bow to it. Florists, bakers, photographers, Internet CEOs and speakers like myself have all discovered personally that the people who say they are fighting for \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctolerance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are often the most intolerant. In the name of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinclusion and diversity,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d those of us who have a diverse view are being excluded because we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exhibit lock-step conformity to their intolerant agenda. We are being fired and fined for exercising our real God-given rights. How can this be? We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work because of our political views\\xe2\\x80\\x94views that are firmly rooted in the biological facts of nature. Is this still America?\\nAt least one advocate of same sex marriage has a real problem with this. Homosexual author Andrew Sullivan expressed revulsion for the intolerance gay activists expressed to former Mozilla CEO Brandon Eich, which ultimately forced his resignation. Sullivan wrote, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe whole episode disgusts me \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as it should disgust anyone interested in a tolerant and diverse society. If this is the gay rights movement today \\xe2\\x80\\x93 hounding our opponents with a fanaticism more like the religious right than anyone else \\xe2\\x80\\x93 then count me out. If we are about intimidating the free speech of others, we are no better than the anti-gay bullies who came before us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Maybe Sullivan is speaking of another time, but most \\xe2\\x80\\x9creligious right\\xe2\\x80\\x9d people I know are tolerant\\xe2\\x80\\x94they would never usurp the free speech or freedom of association rights of those with whom they disagree.)\\nAs headlines nearly every day affirm, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a growing clash between real rights and the new invented right of same sex marriage. Can anyone see any middle ground between 1) you must celebrate my same sex marriage, and 2) God or my conscience prevents me from doing so? There is none. So which \\xe2\\x80\\x9cright\\xe2\\x80\\x9d will take precedence: the real right or the invented right?\\nAccording to lesbian activist Chai Feldbaum, who was appointed by President Obama to the EEOC, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the real right. Speaking about this inevitable conflict between homosexuality and religious liberty she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m having a hard time coming up with any case in which religious liberty should win.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSo the true rights of freedom of religion, speech and association must give way to the invented right of same sex marriage. Your right to live Christianity, or any other faith, must give way to those who demand that you affirm their lifestyle. That isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tolerance. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s totalitarianism.

Neither can Christians. If we celebrate harmful behavior we are being unloving. Love requires we tell people the truth, even if it upsets them.\\nIn fact, if you are upset with me for the thoughts I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve expressed in these three columns, it means that in an important sense you agree with me. If you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like the behaviors and ideas I am advocating here, you are admitting that all behaviors and ideas are not equal\\xe2\\x80\\x94that some are closer to the real objective moral truth than others.

The protesters questioned the role that race \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and simmering tensions between residents and the Police Department \\xe2\\x80\\x94 may have played in the killing of Michael Brown, 18, who was to start college this week.\\nThe standoff lasted for more than an hour, with about a dozen men approaching officers with their hands up saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t shoot me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d At least 100 police officers were on the scene, shining bright lights into the crowd and telling people to return to their homes.\\nAt one point, the sound of gunfire was heard from within the area where the police had barricaded streets in Ferguson. Earlier in the night, several people threw rocks at officers.\\nChief Thomas Jackson of the Ferguson police told The Associated Press that the officers used tear gas and shot \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbeanbag rounds\\xe2\\x80\\x9d after members of the crowd threw rocks at officers and gunfire came from the crowd.\\nChief Jackson said the police blocked off the area where most of the looting and vandalism occurred Sunday night out of concern that cars passing by might hit demonstrators in the street.\\nBrian Schellman, a public information officer with the St. Louis County police, said late Monday that the police had made several arrests for offenses including assaulting a police officer. He said they had no reports of injuries to the police or protesters. Officials have so far declined to identify the police officer who shot Mr. Brown or disclose his race. The officer was put on administrative leave.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have to begin with the frustration,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one of the protesters, Wayne Bledsoe of St. Louis. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTreatment of these communities is not equal. In white communities, the police truly protect and serve. In black communities, that is not the case.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe situation appeared to have calmed down by about 10:30 p.m. local time, the police said. A local news station aired footage of one man who was reportedly taken to a hospital for injuries from a rubber bullet.\\nFerguson, a city of 21,000 northwest of St. Louis, has shifted substantially over the last decade, with blacks, once a minority, now making up two-thirds of the residents, after many white families moved out to surrounding suburbs. The town\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leadership and the police have remained predominantly white.\\nIn 2013, the suspension of a black superintendent of schools by an all-white school board stirred protests. And the Justice Department has a continuing investigation into racial disparities in legal representation for juveniles in Family Court.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe community is still highly segregated,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Karen Knodt, interim pastor of the Immanuel United Church of Christ, whose congregation has 800 members, only four of whom are black. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe institutions of power don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t yet reflect the changing demographics of the county.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAt a news conference on Monday, Jon Belmar, the St. Louis County police chief, who said his department was asked by the Ferguson police to take over the investigation of the shooting, pleaded for the public\\xe2\\x80\\x99s patience.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI understand that the public has a right to be skeptical, and I appreciate that and I would expect that the public be skeptical oftentimes of government or some forms of it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I would also ask the public to be reasonable, because it takes a long time to make sure we do this investigation the right way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nOn social media, reaction to Mr. Brown\\xe2\\x80\\x99s killing was fierce, with many accusing the police of again shooting an unarmed black youth. It included a Twitter campaign called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIfTheyGunnedMeDown\\xe2\\x80\\x9d prompted by a photograph of Mr. Brown that was used in some news reports about his killing. In the photo, Mr. Brown is shown with fingers of his right hand extended in what some considered a peace sign, while others called it a gang sign.\\nMr. Brown\\xe2\\x80\\x99s parents said at a news conference that he was nonviolent and good-natured, and would have objected to the looting. Their lawyer, Benjamin Crump, compared the case to another one in which he represented a family, that of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black 17-year-old shot to death in Florida two years ago by a neighborhood watch coordinator.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe need justice for our son,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Brown\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father, Michael Brown, as his lawyer asked witnesses to step forward with testimony or videotape. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf any of you have information, please give it to us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want no violence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause Michael wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want no violence,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lesley McSpadden, his mother, weeping.\\nThe circumstances of Mr. Brown\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death on Saturday afternoon as he and a friend walked from a convenience store were disputed. The police said he had hit the officer who shot him; his family and friends denied that.\\nIn a local television interview, the friend who was walking with him, Dorian Johnson, said the officer opened fire when the young men refused to move from the middle of the street to the sidewalk. He said Mr. Brown\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hands were over his head. The autopsy showed Mr. Brown was shot a number of times.\\nThe Ferguson police said they do not have videocameras running in their patrol cars. Residents of Ferguson said they were shaken by the unrest that swept the town on Sunday night, bringing 500 officers to the streets.\\nOne school district nearby canceled classes on Monday, citing safety concerns. Many businesses refused to open or boarded up their windows as a protective measure. On West Florissant Street, the aftermath of Sunday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s protest was still visible in a burned-out convenience store, the smashed windows of a thrift shop and lottery tickets that littered a parking lot.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was a miracle that no one was shot,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Chief Belmar said of the looting.\\nOutside the Police Department, groups of residents criticized the police but also condemned the looting from the night before.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want any more violence around here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Carolyn Teague, a nurse, as she wiped away tears. The tension, she said, had one source: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPrejudice in this town still lives on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nPatrice McHaskell, a teacher at a nursery school, said that in a town where the police force is mostly white and residents are mostly black, police officers have acquired a reputation for frequently stopping young black men, often for trivial things.\\nThe shooting has tapped into longstanding resentments, she said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re just outraged and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re tired of the police messing with them. It brought out all the anger and tension that everybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been holding in.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAttorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. seemed to echo concerns from residents, saying in a statement on Monday that the episode \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeserves a fulsome review.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nHe added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAggressively pursuing investigations such as this is critical for preserving trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department sometimes begins its own investigation into police departments that appear to show a pattern and practice of using excessive force, as it did this year in Albuquerque, after a series of shootings by the police involving people suffering from mental illness.\\nThe shooting mobilized supporters, including Cornell Williams Brooks, the president of the N.A.A.C.P., who flew into St. Louis on Monday.

He died there Tuesday night, along with another diplomat and two State Department security officers, when a mob stormed the U.S. Consulate and set it ablaze.\\nThe Benghazi consulate was one of several American diplomatic missions that faced protests after the online release of a film that ridiculed Muslims and depicted the Prophet Mohammed as a child molester, womanizer and ruthless killer.\\nBut U.S. sources said Wednesday the four-hour assault in Benghazi had been planned, with the attackers using the protest as a diversion.\\n\"We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act,\" President Barack Obama said. \"And make no mistake, justice will be done.\"\\nA senior U.S. official told CNN that American surveillance drones are expected to join the hunt for jihadists who may be tied to the attack.

Let\\'s not kid ourselves,\" Boehner said.\\nAs of early Friday evening, no talks were planned between the White House and congressional leadership to avert what could happen in January, an official familiar with the situation said.\\nWith little evidence of a breakthrough, Obama has tried to amp up pressure on Republicans by making his pitch public. The Rodon Manufacturing Group plant in Hatfield that he visited makes K\\'Nex toys, which Obama jokingly offered to members of Congress who make his \"nice\" list.\\nNot on that list are many House Republicans.\\nHow to raise taxes on the rich\\nThe Democratic-controlled Senate has already passed legislation calling for the extension of tax cuts for all but the most wealthy Americans, but the matter has not come up for a vote in the House.\\nRepublicans who control that chamber, many of whom oppose any tax rate increases, have insisted the tax-cut extensions apply to all Americans and balked at considering separately the tax cut that applies to 98% of Americans. Obama says House Republicans are holding \"hostage\" something that would help the vast majority of the country to protect the wealthy few.\\n\"That doesn\\'t make sense,\" the president said, urging Americans to flood House Republicans with calls, letters and social networking messages.\\nAddressing the tax-cut extension for lower- and middle-class families is the most urgent \"ticking clock\" among the provisions in the \"fiscal cliff\" package of automatic tax increases and spending cuts that will take effect January 1 if lawmakers and the administration can\\'t reach a compromise, Obama said.\\nWithout the cut, the administration has argued many Americans could pull back on purchasing during the crucial holiday shopping season.\\nLonger term, analysts and the Congressional Budget Office have said that going and staying over the fiscal cliff -- meaning the tax hikes for all and spending cuts aren\\'t pulled back -- would threaten millions of jobs, especially those dependent on government contracting, and risk a return to recession.\\nWall Street and big businesses are lobbying the administration and lawmakers to reach a deal. Investors have been grappling with the uncertainty over the prospect of higher taxes and damaged consumer confidence caused by political gridlock over deficits and the debt.\\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said the election and polls show public support for extending the \"middle class\" tax cut while raising rates for the wealthiest.\\nShe and her caucus are ready to solicit the support of some Republicans in amassing 218 signatures to bring the Senate tax-cut extension bill up for a vote next week.\\n\"I think we would get a 100% vote on it if it came to the floor,\" the California Democrat said Friday.\\nHow to bridge the fiscal cliff\\nThe remarks came a day after the Obama administration unveiled details of a comprehensive package, widely rejected by Republicans, to avert the fiscal cliff.\\nThe president\\'s proposal calls for $1.6 trillion in increased revenue, some of it the result of higher tax rates for families making more than $250,000.\\nObama also wants to close loopholes, limit deductions, raise the estate tax rate to 2009 levels and increase taxes on capital gains and dividend taxes.\\nThe proposal also calls for additional spending, including a new $50 billion stimulus package, a home mortgage refinancing plan and an extension of unemployment insurance benefits.

      "features:b'A poll by Gallup found that the uninsured rate among U.S adults declined to 11.9% in the first quarter, down one percentage point from the end of last year and an improvement from the 18% without insurance in the fall of 2013, when the Americans were first were able to sign up for coverage at state and federal exchanges.\\nThis is the lowest percentage of Americans without coverage since Gallup started tracking the figure in 2008.

      "features:b'The Trump White House has devolved to a new low of chaotic infighting.\\nThe president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s son-in-law just lost his top-secret clearance and, under increasing ethical scrutiny, is said to be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cparanoid\\xe2\\x80\\x9d about who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leaking against him. One of the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s closest aides, Hope Hicks, is leaving and may be facing her own legal woes. His family is clashing with his chief of staff. Rumors are swirling that his national security adviser might soon be pushed out too, and that his top economic adviser could quit. On top of all that, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s angrily lashing out at his attorney general on Twitter and trying to interfere with an investigation \\xe2\\x80\\x94 again.\\nMany of these are long-simmering grudges and problems in the administration. But they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been further destabilized by new developments like the scandal over White House staff secretary Rob Porter and a round of reports that special counsel Robert Mueller is looking into what seems to be everything under the sun. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re already seeing policy consequences, with Trump circumventing what had been the policy process to declare he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d impose new tariffs.\\nThe Porter scandal tipped the dominoes\\nAfter President Trump fired Reince Priebus and replaced him with John Kelly last July, the retired general tried to bring some more rigor to what had been a messy and disorganized White House process. Kelly saw no use for those he saw as bombastic, machiavellian troublemakers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 like Anthony Scaramucci and Steve Bannon, both of whom he pushed out within weeks. Other outside advisers in Trumpworld, too, saw their access cut off.\\nBut when it came to Jared Kushner, the presidential son-in-law who had a seemingly limitless portfolio, Kelly took a different tack. He scaled back Kushner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s portfolio but didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t oust him or first daughter Ivanka Trump, allowing them to continue to hold prominent White House posts. As for Hope Hicks \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a favorite of the president and ally of Jared and Ivanka, though viewed by some as underqualified \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Kelly ended up agreeing to promote her to communications director on a permanent basis.\\nAt the same time, Kelly enlisted White House staff secretary Rob Porter as a key ally in his quest to get more control over the paper flow to Trump, the workings of the policy process, and who got to go into the Oval Office. Porter, it so happened, was dating Hicks.\\nSo an equilibrium emerged. The old retired general, Kelly, would tolerate the two romantically entwined pairs of younger high-level White House aides (Porter and Hicks, Jared and Ivanka), rather than gunning for them \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and vice versa.\\nBut when Porter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history of alleged spousal abuse came to light, leading to his ouster from the White House, the dominoes began to fall:\\nAll of this has led to some alarm in Trumpworld, with Scaramucci perhaps speaking for the Jared/Ivanka/Hicks camp when he sounded off Thursday about Kelly (who, we should remember, fired him). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoes the president want to lose everyone because of General Jackass?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Scaramucci asked Jennifer Jacobs of Bloomberg News. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe guy is a bad dude. Fear and intimidation doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work in a civilian organization.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nPorter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exit also seems to have helped lead to tariffs\\nMeanwhile, Porter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exit also seems to have caused, or at least contributed to, tumult on an entirely separate topic: trade policy.\\nAll along, there has been a camp of advisers in the administration who have been pushing for tariffs and other \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctougher\\xe2\\x80\\x9d trade policies \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including White House aide Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. But up to this point, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve generally been marginalized by a more establishment-friendly group, including National Economic Council chair Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and, it seems, Rob Porter.\\nBut Politico\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Ben White and Andrew Restuccia report that in the days since Porter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ouster, the trade hawks have gained ascendancy:\\nCohn had been working closely with former staff secretary Rob Porter to postpone, kill or narrow the scope of the tariffs. But Porter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s departure last month amid domestic abuse allegations further complicated their efforts.\\nPorter had been organizing weekly trade meetings in which senior officials and Cabinet secretaries debated the merits of the proposals. Without Porter to organize the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s policy debate, Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advisers reverted back to the chaos of the early days of the administration, where aides fell all over each other to influence the president in any way they could.\\nMeanwhile, the Times\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Ana Swanson recently reported that not only Navarro is a player again, but Trump has promised him a new promotion. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAmid the tumult, Mr. Navarro has been able to leverage a close personal relationship with the president to gain more access,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Swanson wrote, citing a source close to the White House.\\nThis led to a chaotic day of conflicting reports leading up to Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surprise announcement yesterday, with no details, that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to put a tariff of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports. Cohn is now rumored to be considering quitting the White House in response.\\nBut not all the drama is Porter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fault\\nYet it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too simple to claim that without the Porter scandal, the Trump administration would be in great shape on a personnel front. Two other matters have been problems for months, and returned to the headlines this week.\\nOne is the position of National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been widely reported that Trump doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get along with McMaster, who has been rumored to be headed for the exits for a while. But on Thursday, some sources sent up a trial balloon for ousting him to MSNBC. The new development was that Kelly and Secretary of Defense James Mattis were said to be on board with the plan too.\\nStill, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth remembering that there was a report like this about Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supposedly imminent ouster last November \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still around three months later. (An NSC spokesperson called the report on McMaster \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfake news.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)\\nLast but most certainly not least, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the never-ending drama surrounding Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a drama that could have major consequences for the Russia probe.\\nBoth in private and in public (and on Twitter), Trump has mocked and harshly criticized Sessions since he recused himself from oversight of the Russia probe, in an apparent effort to pressure him into resigning. (Sessions hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t taken the bait.) The president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attention to the issue has waxed and waned, but on Wednesday, he sent another furious tweet Sessions\\xe2\\x80\\x99s way, which set off a new round of chatter that Trump could fire Sessions.\\nWhy is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc. Isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!\\nTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s specific criticism of Sessions here makes no sense, but the bigger picture is that, as he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s said repeatedly, he wants the Justice Department to do more to investigate his political enemies and is annoyed that Sessions won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take a greater personal role in doing so.\\nIf Trump does pull the trigger and fire Sessions, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d set off yet another crisis to embroil his administration and throw the future of the Mueller investigation into question. (Sessions is recused from oversight over the probe, but a new attorney general wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily be \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and could rein it in.)\\nWill he do it? Who knows. But Axios\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Jonathan Swan and Mike Allen had a pithy sentence to describe where things are now: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrump is in a bad, mad place.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'HIROSHIMA, Japan \\xe2\\x80\\x94 President Obama laid a wreath at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial on Friday, telling an audience that included survivors of America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s atomic bombing in 1945 that technology as devastating as nuclear arms demands a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmoral revolution.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThousands of Japanese lined the route of the presidential motorcade to the memorial in the hopes of glimpsing Mr. Obama, the first sitting American president to visit the most potent symbol of the dawning of the nuclear age. Many watched the ceremony on their cellphones.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSeventy-one years ago, on a bright cloudless morning, death fell from the sky and the world was changed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Obama said in opening his speech at the memorial.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTechnological progress without an equivalent progress in human institutions can doom us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Obama said, adding that such technology \\xe2\\x80\\x9crequires a moral revolution as well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn an emotional moment afterward, Mr. Obama embraced and shook hands with survivors of the attack, which exposed humanity to risks the president has repeatedly said the world must do far more to resolve.\\nThe first of those survivors, Sunao Tsuboi, a chairman of the Hiroshima branch of the Japan Confederation of A- and H-bomb Sufferers Organizations, gripped Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand and did not let go until he had spoken to him for some time.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI held his hand, and we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need an interpreter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Tsuboi, 91, said later. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI could understand what he wanted to say by his expression.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn another poignant moment, Mr. Obama exchanged an embrace with Shigeaki Mori, 79, who was 8 years old when the bomb fell. Mr. Mori spent decades researching the fates of American prisoners of war who were killed in the bombing.\\nFor weeks, the White House had refused to say whether Mr. Obama, would meet survivors. It was a delicate decision. Many survivors long for an apology for an event that destroyed just about everyone and everything they knew, and there were small demonstrations near the ceremony on Friday by protesters demanding an apology. But Mr. Obama said before his trip that he would not apologize for the attack.\\nStill, Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s homage to the victims and his speech were welcomed by many Japanese. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am simply grateful for his visit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Tomoko Miyoshi, 50, who lost 10 relatives in the Hiroshima attack and wept as she watched Mr. Obama on her cellphone.\\nIn his speech, Mr. Obama, using the slow and deliberate cadence that he uses on only the most formal and consequential occasions, said that the bombing of Hiroshima demonstrated that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmankind possessed the means to destroy itself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut he said that in the 71 years since the bombing, world institutions had grown up to help prevent a recurrence. Still, nations like the United States continue to possess thousands of nuclear weapons. And that is something that must change, he said.\\nIn a striking example of the gap between Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vision of a nuclear weapons-free world and the realities of purging them, a new Pentagon census of the American nuclear arsenal shows his administration has reduced the stockpile less than any other post-Cold War presidency.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe must have the courage to escape the logic of fear and pursue a world without them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, although he quickly added: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe may not realize this goal in my lifetime, but persistent effort can roll back the possibility of catastrophe.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nStill, he said, more was needed. Noting that far more primitive weapons than nuclear arms are causing widespread destruction today, Mr. Obama called for humanity to change its mind-set about war.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe world was forever changed here, but today the children of this city will go through their day in peace,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Obama said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat a precious thing that is. It is worth protecting, and then extending to every child. That is a future we can choose, a future in which Hiroshima and Nagasaki are known not as the dawn of atomic warfare but as the start of our own moral awakening.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nPeople in Asian countries that were brutalized by imperial Japan had warned that a presidential apology at Hiroshima would be inappropriate. Mr. Obama not only did not apologize, he made clear that Japan, despite a highly advanced culture, was to blame for the war, which \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgrew out of the same base instinct for domination or conquest that had caused conflicts among the simplest tribes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn his speech, the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis tragedy must not be allowed to occur again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are determined to realize a world free of nuclear weapons,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nAmerican veterans groups had a mostly muted response, neither criticizing nor endorsing Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s visit and remarks. Joe Davis, a spokesman in Washington for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the oldest veterans organization in the United States, issued a brief statement saying \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca world without conflict is a vision we should all share.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s visit to Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park had all the pomp, ceremony and planned choreography of a state visit or a leader\\xe2\\x80\\x99s funeral. With thousands in attendance and much of Japan watching on TV, Mr. Obama walked forward alone at the park and laid a wreath on a white pyramid. He paused before the memorial\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cenotaph, his head bowed.\\nA moment later, Mr. Abe approached with his own wreath, which he laid beside Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on another pyramid. After a moment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reflection, the two leaders shook hands \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a clear signal of the extraordinary alliance their two nations had forged out of the ashes of war.\\nMr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to visit Hiroshima was in part intended to reward Mr. Abe for his efforts to improve ties and forge a closer military relationship between the two countries. The recent  slaying  of a young woman on Okinawa, and the arrest of an American Marine veteran in the crime, has once again strained those ties, but coordination between the two nations\\xe2\\x80\\x99 militaries continues to intensify.\\nMr. Obama also saw the visit as a testament to mankind\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to forge beyond even the most intense of enmities. Before arriving in Japan, Mr. Obama visited Vietnam, where he lifted a longstanding arms embargo.\\nThe Hiroshima visit, under consideration since the first days of Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presidency, could send ripples across Asia, a region still grappling with the echoes of World War II seven decades after it ended. Leaders in both China and South Korea worry that Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s visit to Japan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deepest wound could be taken by the Japanese as an endpoint to their country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fitful efforts to come to grips with their own wartime atrocities.\\nBut with a reclusive regime in North Korea furiously building more nuclear weapons and trying to perfect the missiles to deliver them, Mr. Obama decided that reminding the world why the North Koreans must be stopped was worth any hurt feelings among other countries.\\nMany historians believe the bombings on Hiroshima and then Nagasaki, which together took the lives of more than 200,000 people, saved lives on balance, since an invasion of the islands would have led to far greater bloodshed. But the 30-acre Peace Memorial Park that Mr. Obama visited reflects none of that background.\\nThe park offers a victim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s narrative, illustrating in gut-wrenching detail how more than 100,000 people in the city perished and thousands more were injured. It provides few of the historical reasons for the bombing, such as descriptions of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the savagery of Japan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s occupation of China, or the extraordinary death toll of soldiers and civilians in the invasion of Okinawa.\\nA short inscription on the park\\xe2\\x80\\x99s memorial arch reads, in part, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe shall not repeat the evil.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Which evil \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the bombing or the conflict itself \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and who is to blame are left unsaid.\\nSuch failures by the Japanese to acknowledge their own role in the bombings has long bothered the Chinese, Koreans and others who suffered under the empire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rule. And with Mr. Abe as Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s host, those wounded feelings could fester. Mr. Abe has promoted a version of history that plays down Japan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wartime transgressions, and he has moved to give the military limited powers to fight in foreign conflicts, shedding pacifist constraints in place since World War II.\\nThe Chinese government suggested on Friday that the wartime atrocities committed by Japan on Chinese soil, notably in the city of Nanjing, deserved more attention than the bombing of Hiroshima. President Park Geun-hye of South Korea has not commented on Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s visit and is on a tour of several African countries.' target:-1\n",

And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not just happening on the coasts. As the storm progresses and the heavy rain continues to fall, rivers and creeks further inland will start to overflow as well. Not helping: The fact that the ground in the Carolinas is already saturated from a storm-filled summer. That will lead to more surface runoff inland.\\nFor instance, the Cape Fear River in Fayetteville, North Carolina, is about 100 miles from the coast.

But in the wake of Donald Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s five-state sweep in the Northeast yesterday, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time to add another measure.\\nAnd that is psychology.\\nWhich may be his biggest advantage.\\nBy adding Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Connecticut and Rhode Island to his New York landslide, Trump is clearly riding a wave of momentum and positive media coverage.\\nBut when you get to math, the journalistic nitpickers come up with various scenarios in which Trump may not get to 1,237, leaving him vulnerable to a contested convention. Fair enough. (Yes, any other front-runner would have been declared the de facto nominee, but The Donald is a rather controversial fellow.)\\nWhich brings us to the psychology surrounding a candidate who has won state after state in all regions of the country\\xe2\\x80\\x94from Alabama to Massachusetts, from Georgia to New Hampshire, from Florida to Nevada, from South Carolina to Illinois. And look at the margins: 46 percent in Arizona, 46 percent in Florida, 47 percent in Mississippi, 60 percent in New York.\\nTed Cruz won Wisconsin by an impressive 48 percent, but outside of his 44 percent victory in Texas, and nearly matching Trump with 41 percent in Missouri, most of his wins have come in caucus states where he has outperformed his rival at the inside game.\\nCruz pivoted to a different target last night, saying the media were having \"palpitations\" over Trump&aposs expected big night and that he is the fourth estate&aposs \"chosen\" candidate. That&aposs become a standard Cruz riff, even as Trump gets more than his share of bad press and biting commentary and himself complains about the \"dishonest\" media.\\nWhat&aposs true is that as Trump continues to pile up primary wins, the psychology shifts, and most of the media and political establishments now expect him to be the nominee\\xe2\\x80\\x94whether they regard that prospect with excitement or loathing. Six in 10 Republicans say in a recent poll that the candidate with the most votes should be the party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s standard-bearer, magic number or not. Two-thirds of Connecticut Republicans said the same in an exit poll yesterday.\\nThat leaves Cruz, who has way exceeded expectations in this campaign, in the position of arguing that he should be the alternative to Trump, even as he loses state after state. (Yes, Cruz could win Indiana next week, but that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t change the overall equation.)\\nAnd it leaves John Kasich, who has won exactly one state\\xe2\\x80\\x94his own\\xe2\\x80\\x94arguing that a fractured convention should turn to him.\\nThe Cruz-Kasich non-aggression pact quickly fizzled, and not just because the two rivals said they still wanted votes in the three states where they are not campaigning in deference to the other guy. It was because their supporters don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have much in common, and they handed Trump the argument that his opponents are playing insider games to deprive him of the prize.\\nPsychology isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t everything. Trump could hit a rough patch as he toggles between appearing more presidential and mocking Kasich\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eating habits.

The White House has suggested that plan would not be effective.\\nBut the NRA and other firearms group say the same about proposed restrictions on certain weapons types, noting that assault weapons are not often used in the commission of violent crimes -- handguns are more common.\\nBiden also drew complaints from Republican lawmakers when he suggested Wednesday, while meeting with gun control groups, that the administration might go around Congress to implement some provisions.\\n\"There are executive orders, executive action that can be taken,\" Biden said.

Kaiser Family Foundation, said upon seeing a description of the proposal. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt seems to tilt heavily towards what the Freedom Caucus has been looking for.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nRepublicans argue that the high-risk pools would then cover those people, taking them out of the regular insurance pool and lowering prices for everyone else, but high-risk pools have traditionally been underfunded by states and the federal government, resulting in poor coverage and high costs for those who need insurance the most.\\nSo basically they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re hoping to con people out of noticing that Essential Health Benefits and pre-existing protections will be gone (at least in many states) until it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too late.\\nThe MacArthur Amendment does nothing about Trumpcare\\xe2\\x80\\x99s giant cuts to Medicaid, which many Republican so-called moderates have said were unacceptable. As former Harry Reid staffer Adam Jentleson tweeted, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMacArthur has put moderates in position to take the blame if the new bill fails and lose their seats if it passes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d' target:-1\n",

      "features:b'Debt ceiling would be raised until February 7\\nHouse Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday that the House \"absolutely\" will take up the new Senate budget plan -- even if he has to rely on mostly Democrats to pass it -- and that he expects the partial government shutdown to end by Thursday.\\nBoehner made the comments in an interview with Cincinnati radio station WLW-AM.\\n\"We fought the good fight. We just didn&apost win,\" he said.\\nBoehner spoke as the Senate was preparing to vote on a recently struck bipartisan deal to end the partial government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling.\\nThe Senate proposal would fund the government through Jan. 15, and raise the debt cap through Feb. 7.\\nThe plan would not include any provision relating to the ObamaCare medical device tax, as prior plans did; instead it would include a single provision meant to verify the income of those receiving ObamaCare subsidies. It would also instruct a bipartisan budget committee to report back on a broader plan by mid-December.\\nLawmakers on both sides acknowledged the deal was far from perfect, and once again pushes off difficult and long-term decisions about the country&aposs fiscal health for another day.\\n\"This deal is yet another promise to work on the problem tomorrow,\" Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., said in a statement.\\nIt also tees up another confrontation weeks down the road if the two sides are unable to scratch out a longer-term deal. But, for the near-term, it would lift the partial shutdown that began on Oct. 1 and remove the threat of missing the debt-ceiling deadline on Thursday.\\nThe big question had been whether, if the bill passes the Senate, Boehner would allow it to come to the floor. Though many Republicans remain resistant to the plan -- in large part because it does not significantly address ObamaCare -- it could potentially pass with a combination of moderate Republicans and Democrats.\\nAsked Wednesday if he&aposd let the House vote, even if a majority of Republicans wouldn&apost support it, Boehner said: \"Oh, absolutely.\"\\nBut Boehner added he&aposll encourage Republicans to support it.\\n\"We fought the good fight. There&aposs no reason for our members to vote no today,\" he said. Boehner said he anticipates the partial shutdown will be over by Thursday.\\nBoehner met with his rank-and-file members Wednesday afternoon ahead of the Senate vote. The House is planning to take up the measure shortly afterward. One House GOP leadership aide said it appears there&aposs enough support to pass the bill.\\nBoehner, in deciding to let the Senate bill come to the floor, had been left with few options.\\nThe night before, Boehner had been forced to shelve his chamber&aposs alternative bill amid resistance from conservatives, and just about every Democrat. Conservatives complained it didn&apost go far enough in eroding ObamaCare. Already Wednesday, those same lawmakers were being pressured by conservative groups to vote \"no\" on the emerging deal.\\nBoehner could have tried to put forward a new proposal, which would easily put the government past Thursday&aposs deadline to raise the debt ceiling.\\nThe other option was simply bringing the Senate bill to the floor, relying on some Republicans and a lot of Democrats to pass it. Despite pressure to oppose the bill from groups like the Club for Growth, moderate Republicans disenchanted with the Tea Party&aposs confrontational approach could peel off and join their Democratic colleagues.\\nHouse Democrats were already planning for that possibility. Senior House Democratic sources told Fox News that the party is confident they can deliver most of their caucus on the vote.\\nThe current House breakdown is 232 Republicans and 200 Democrats. That means Republicans need help from Democrats if they lose just 16 members.\\nHouse Democrats held a formal meeting Wednesday afternoon, as Senate leaders charged ahead with votes expected later in the day. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, helped clear the way for that vote when he announced he would not filibuster, though he opposes the deal itself.\\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney, indicating President Obama would support the plan, said the president believes it \"achieves what&aposs necessary.\"\\nThe model for a bill being passed largely by Democrats is the vote in January on aid for Hurricane Sandy victims. The House approved it 241-180 -- but with only 49 Republican yeas and a robust 192 Democratic yeas.\\nThe move would be risky for Boehner, and could potentially trigger another effort down the road, from the right, to challenge his speakership. Letting a bill pass on the backs of votes from the minority party would violate what is loosely known as the \"Hastert Rule\" -- named after former Speaker Dennis Hastert, and referring to the principle that the party in control of the House should make sure that party is mostly on board with any bill coming to the floor.\\nBut would Boehner really be in trouble by relying on Democrats? One senior House Republican said it&aposs \"highly unlikely\" that a new leader would emerge \"that can raise money, message\" and corral the warring factions of the party.\\n\"Boehner takes the high road,\" the aide predicted. \"He tried to do the right thing. It&aposs not like he hasn&apost been warning us.\"\\nSince initially demanding that ObamaCare be defunded as part of any budget deal, Republican leaders have scaled back those demands considerably. The boldest provision in the most recent House bill would have forced top government officials and lawmakers onto ObamaCare, without subsidies.\\nBut the latest version was still too heavy-handed for Democrats, and too weak for conservatives. The final version only addressed income verification for subsidies.\\nFox News&apos Chad Pergram contributed to this report.' target:1\n",

Most opinion polls showed him trailing in a crowded field of better-funded competitors.\\nBut he pulled off an upset with an unapologetically liberal agenda and grassroots campaign in a battleground state, where Democrats have been shut out of the governor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office for two decades.\\nGillum\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nomination marks a departure from previous white, centrist nominees who have lost. His campaign featured fiery calls for expansive government-run healthcare, higher wages for workers and Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impeachment.\\nThe 39-year-old son of a bus driver highlighted the power of his historic candidacy to rouse younger and more racially diverse voters who often sit out midterm elections.\\nAccusations of race-baiting quickly flared when the Republican nominee, Congressman Ron DeSantis, in a national television interview called his opponent charismatic and articulate but too liberal for Florida, where voters would not want \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto monkey this up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn Arizona, David Garcia, a Latino progressive candidate, secured the Democratic nomination for governor in a contest seen as a longer shot for the party to win.\\nAn educator and veteran, Garcia has called for tuition-free college and reform of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. He was immediately blasted by Republicans as too radical for the electorate in the November general election, when he will face incumbent Republican Governor Doug Ducey.\\nFlorida Republican nominee DeSantis thanked President Donald Trump for his landslide win. The president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s endorsement helped to catapult the conservative once seen as a longshot candidate for governor to a 20-percentage point win in the Republican nominating contest.\\nHis trouncing of the early establishment favorite, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, underscored the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s popularity with the Republican base.\\nDeSantis, 39, is the latest in a string of Republican candidates elevated this year by the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s engagement in intraparty fights.\\nWhile Trump held off endorsing any of the three Republicans in a contentious U.S. Senate battle in Arizona, the candidates all spent the final stretch of the campaign touting their allegiance to him.\\nEstablishment favorite U.S. Representative Martha McSally fended off two hard-line conservatives, former state senator Kelli Ward and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, in a southwestern state that Trump won by about 4 percentage points.\\nTrump posted on Twitter a full-throttled endorsement for her candidacy on Wednesday morning and claimed sweeping wins for his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMake America Great Again\\xe2\\x80\\x9d agenda. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is morphing into KEEP AMERICA GREAT!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he wrote.\\nIn Oklahoma, political newcomer Kevin Stitt won a runoff for the Republican nomination after closely aligning himself with Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s agenda.\\nUp and down the ballot, female candidates in both parties continued to dominate key races in a year with record numbers of women seeking office.\\nArizona will have its first female U.S. senator, whether it is McSally, 52, or Democratic opponent U.S. Representative Kyrsten Sinema, 42. The winner may decide which party controls the chamber where Republicans now hold a one-seat majority.\\nFormer Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick won the Democratic nomination for McSally\\xe2\\x80\\x99s congressional seat in the suburbs around Tucson. Republican businesswoman Lea Marquez Peterson also won her party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nomination for the competitive district.\\nIn Florida, however, the lone female candidate for governor, Gwen Graham, was defeated by Gillum, a stunning loss after she had spent months as the apparent frontrunner.\\nBut Democrat Donna Shalala, a longtime party insider who ran the U.S. healthcare agenda under former President Bill Clinton, bested several male candidates to win the nomination for a competitive congressional seat in Miami.\\nShe will square off against Republican Maria Elvira Salazar, a Spanish-language television journalist.\\nBoth are seeking the seat vacated by retiring Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen in a contest that could present the Democrats with one their best opportunities nationally to flip a Republican seat.\\nSalazar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s background, however, could help Republicans hold onto the seat in a district where about three-fourths of the population is Hispanic but which favored Hillary Clinton by nearly 20 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election.\\nReporting by Letitia Stein; Editing by Colleen Jenkins, Simon Cameron-Moore and David Gregorio' target:0\n",

      "features:b'PARIS \\xe2\\x80\\x94 President Barack Obama urged the world to consider the climate talks that kicked off here Monday as potentially the last chance to make a meaningful impact on combating climate change.\\nWhat the world needs to agree on, Obama told the 150-odd other world leaders gathered in Paris for the two-week conference, is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot a stopgap solution, but a long-term strategy that gives the world confidence in a low-carbon future.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nStory Continued Below\\nObama quoted Martin Luther King Jr., saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is such a thing as being too late.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen it comes to climate change, that hour is almost upon us. But if we act here, now, if we place our short-term interests behind the air that our children will breathe and the water our children will drink,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Obama said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthen we will not be too late for them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nObama noted the backdrop of the Nov. 13 terror attacks, casting a climate agreement as a rebuke to the terrorists, much as he did in speaking at his news conference with French President Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois Hollande at the White House last week.\\n\"We salute the people of Paris for insisting this crucial conference go on,\" Obama said, calling it \"an act of defiance that proves nothing will deter us from building the future we want for our children.\"\\n\"Through our presence here today, we show that we are stronger than the terrorists,\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel echoed in her own remarks.\\nThe summit, housed in a conference center in the suburbs of the French capital, will be seeking a collective, nonbinding agreement among nations setting their own plans to cut carbon emissions, largely through switching to renewable energy production over fossil fuels. The burden falls differently on countries at various stages of development: The United States and China, the two largest carbon emitters, are pledging to cut their own production and increase clean-up efforts, while developing countries worry that they will be left behind by restrictions that keep them from ever reaching that level of industrialization.\\nObama addressed this imbalance directly, warning that all would suffer if the planet continues to grow warmer at its current pace, but that smaller economies could suffer most from drought, famine and other environmental impacts.\\nA future of rising seas and temperatures, Obama said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis not one of strong economies, nor is it one where fragile states can find their footing. That future is one that we have the power to change, right here, right now. But only if we rise to this moment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSince the agreement being sought is nonbinding, it wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t require congressional authorization if it comes through. Back home, there does seem to be a growing sense of the threat posed by climate change, with two-thirds of people calling it a serious threat in a new ABC News poll out Monday morning \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but the sense of what to do about it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t falling where Obama would like: Just 43 percent of people believe most scientists agree on the causes (the number within the scientific community is close to 99 percent agreement about humans causing the changes), and only 47 percent say the federal government should do more than it is doing now to try to deal with global warming, down from a high of 70 percent under the Bush administration eight years ago.\\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump reflected those sentiments in an interview on MSNBC\\'s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMorning Joe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on Monday morning, calling Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s warning of global warming as a top threat \\xe2\\x80\\x9cone of the dumbest statements I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever heard in politics.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen we have large groups of people that want to blow up every one of our cities, that want to destroy our country, that want to kill our people, and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worried about global warming,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the dumbest things I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen, or perhaps most naive.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTackling climate change is a shared mission for mankind.

      "features:b'WASHINGTON \\xe2\\x80\\x94 President Obama said Monday that he would wait for the outcome of peace talks before deciding whether to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine. Such assistance would represent a striking break with European allies who say that arming the country against Russian aggression would make the conflict worse.\\nIn a joint White House news conference with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Mr. Obama said he was hopeful that economic sanctions would persuade President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to seize a diplomatic solution. But he said the United States would consider sending defensive weapons to Ukraine if European-led talks scheduled for this week did not produce peace.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf, in fact, diplomacy fails, what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve asked my team to do is to look at all options,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Obama said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat other means can we put in place to change Mr. Putin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s calculus? And the possibility of lethal defensive weapons is one of those options that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being examined.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMany leaders in European capitals share the Obama administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deep distrust of Mr. Putin, but they continue to hope that the pressure of economic sanctions will lead him to accept some sort of settlement. But the major Western European countries, including Britain, Germany and France, oppose sending arms.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe continue to pursue a diplomatic solution, although we have suffered a lot of setbacks,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Merkel said during her White House visit.\\nThe potential disagreement between the American president and his European counterparts was on stark display as Ms. Merkel said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see a military solution to this conflict.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But she appeared to suggest that an American decision to send arms despite Berlin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s objections would not lead to a major break in American-German relations, noting that \\xe2\\x80\\x9con certain issues we may not always agree.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAfter a meeting with Ms. Merkel early Monday evening in Ottawa, Canada\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prime minister, Stephen Harper, echoed Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words from earlier in the day. Although he expressed his hope that diplomacy would resolve the situation in Ukraine, Mr. Harper repeatedly noted that Russia continued to pursue a military approach.\\nAsked if Canada will supply weapons to Ukraine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s government, he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll look at all options, but obviously, we will proceed with caution and in collaboration with all our allies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe issue of whether to provide more than nonlethal military aid to Ukraine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s army has threatened to cleave what has until now been a united front among the United States and some of its major European allies over how to respond to the Ukrainian conflict, which has been stoked by a steady supply of weapons and soldiers from Russia. But both Ms. Merkel and Mr. Obama sought to play down the impact of a disagreement, saying the international coalition that has backed economic sanctions against Russia would survive such a dispute.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRussian aggression has only reinforced the unity between the United States, Germany and other European allies,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the president said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to continue to be a strong, unified response between the United States and Europe; that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to change.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMs. Merkel said the alliance would remain \\xe2\\x80\\x9csolid\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and added that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis trans-Atlantic partnership for Germany and for Europe is indispensable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMr. Obama signaled his willingness to wait for Ms. Merkel, Mr. Putin and the leaders of Ukraine and France to seek a negotiated cease-fire at a meeting scheduled for Wednesday in Minsk, the capital of Belarus. But Mr. Obama hinted at the potential rift over providing weapons, saying there \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmay be some areas where there are tactical disagreements.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s comments suggested that arguments in favor of lethal aid by some of his senior advisers have made their way to his desk.\\nNATO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s military commander, Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, said at a security conference in Munich on Saturday that if economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure failed to persuade Mr. Putin to remove his forces from Ukraine and to stop helping the separatists, then sending defensive arms should not be ruled out. On Capitol Hill last week, Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s choice to be the next defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, said he would be inclined to support Ukraine with defensive weapons.\\nIn a speech on Saturday at the Munich conference, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Ukrainian people have a right to defend themselves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But he stopped short of saying that the United States would provide lethal weapons.\\nSenator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on Monday accused Mr. Obama and Ms. Merkel of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9c \\xe2\\x80\\x98more of the same\\xe2\\x80\\x99 diplomatic strategy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and urged them to provide defensive weapons immediately.\\nMr. McCain said that providing such arms to Ukraine was \\xe2\\x80\\x9can essential component to achieving\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a political solution because it would intensify the pressure on Mr. Putin to come to the negotiating table.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs Russian soldiers fail to return home from Ukraine, Putin will be challenged to sustain a war that he has told his people is not happening,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. McCain said.\\nMr. Obama and Ms. Merkel spoke after European foreign ministers agreed to postpone imposing a new round of sanctions against Russia, hoping to avert a rift with the United States over sending arms.\\nEuropean governments decided late last month to expand the list of people under sanctions \\xe2\\x80\\x94 those who face the freezing of their assets and travel bans \\xe2\\x80\\x94 after pro-Russian rebels mounted a rocket attack on Mariupol, a Ukrainian port city, killing about 30 Ukrainian civilians.\\nThe sanctions apply currently to more than 130 Russians and Ukrainian separatist leaders supported by Russia.\\nSpeaking to reporters early Monday in Brussels, the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, expressed uncertainty over what he called the \\xe2\\x80\\x9chopefully possible summit in Minsk.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn Berlin, Mr. Steinmeier\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spokesman, Martin Sch\\xc3\\xa4fer, said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe can only reiterate that we do not know whether this will go well.

Jeff Sessions, the Alabama Republican who heads up Trump\\'s group of national security advisers, and former Texas Gov.

If you\\'re a Second Amendment person or anyone who loves the Constitution, Donald Trump\\'s your man.\"\\nSessions suggested that Trump\\'s claim that Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment was more than just hyperbole, saying \"in essence\" Clinton would accomplish that by appointing a justice who would reverse the Heller decision.\\nIn a statement shortly after the group announced its endorsement of Trump, Cox said \"the stakes in this year\\'s presidential election could not be higher for gun owners.\"\\n\"If Hillary Clinton gets the opportunity to replace Antonin Scalia with an anti-gun Supreme Court justice, we will lose the individual right to keep a gun in the home for self-defense,\" Cox said. \"Mrs. Clinton has said that the Supreme Court got it wrong on the Second Amendment.

If it doesn\\'t, we\\'ll continue the maximum pressure campaign that\\'s been ongoing,\" said spokesperson Sarah Sanders.\\nThe groundbreaking agreement for Mr Kim and Mr Trump to meet came about as North Korea said it was committed to denuclearising the Korean peninsula.\\nExactly what that would entail has remained unclear, but North Korea has invited foreign media to witness the dismantling of its main nuclear test site later this month.\\nMr Bolton recently said North Korea could follow a \"Libya model\" of verifiable denuclearisation, but this alarms Pyongyang, which watched Libya\\'s Colonel Gaddafi give up his nuclear programme only for him to be killed by Western-backed rebels a few years later.\\nThe BBC\\'s Laura Bicker in Seoul says North Korea - which had long said its nuclear arsenal is essential for its survival as a state - is now making its demands clear.\\nLaura Bicker, BBC News, Seoul\\nThe whole reason it has spent years building up a nuclear arsenal, at such a great cost, is for survival.\\nSo to compare denuclearisation in North Korea with Libya or indeed Iraq as John Bolton did on Sunday is not going to offer much comfort. Both regimes collapsed.\\nThis is also a warning shot to the Trump administration. They will be aware how much Mr Trump wants this summit and how it is being spun as a success brought about by his maximum pressure strategy.\\nThere were signs this boasting irritated Pyongyang, but now it has decided to speak out through someone in a position of power.\\nNorth Korea wants the world to know that it is coming to the negotiating table from a position of strength, and they may feel that they are making all the concessions.\\nThey\\'ve suspended all missile tests, released the three US detainees, Kim Jong-un met President Moon and the pair signed a declaration, and they\\'re about to dismantle a nuclear test site in front of international media.\\nSo to hear the Trump administration claiming credit for a deal they don\\'t like has been a step too far.\\nThese statements more than hint that North Korea is prepared to walk away from President Trump\\'s summit in Singapore until it does hear a deal it does like.\\nMr Kim\\'s statement, carried by state media, said that if the US \"corners us and unilaterally demands we give up nuclear weapons we will no longer have an interest in talks\" and \"will have to reconsider\" attending the 12 June summit in Singapore.\\nHe said North Korea did have \"high hopes\" but that it was \"very unfortunate that the US is provoking us ahead of the summit by spitting out ludicrous statements\".\\nKim Kye-gwan is known to be highly respected in the North Korean leadership and has taken part in negotiations with the US before. There is very little chance his comments were not personally endorsed by Kim Jong-un.\\nHours before the announcement, in a sign of growing problems, North Korea had also pulled out of a meeting scheduled with South Korea on Wednesday. because of anger over the start of US-South Korea joint military drills.\\nNorth Korea had earlier said it would allow them to go ahead, but then called them \"a provocative military ruckus\" which was undermining its diplomatic efforts.\\nThe sudden change in tone from Pyongyang is said to have taken US officials by surprise. Analysts said North Korea could be trying to strengthen its hand before talks.\\nThe US state department said it was continuing to plan the Trump-Kim meeting, and Mr Trump is yet to comment.\\nA Chinese government spokesman urged North Korea and the US to \"meet each other halfway\" ahead of negotiations.\\nThe hawkish conservative is a firm defender of US power and a confrontational advocate for wielding that strength abroad. He has previously said it would be \"perfectly legitimate\" to carry out a pre-emptive strike on North Korea.\\nIn media interviews over the weekend, he said North Korea could follow a Libyan model of nuclear disarmament - Libya gave up its weapons\\' programmes in the early 2000s and only then secured economic aid and normalised relations with the US.\\nHowever during the 2011 uprising against Colonel Gaddafi\\'s regime, Western powers intervened in Libya in favour of the rebels, and Gaddafi was captured and killed.\\nNorth Korea has in the past suggested that Libya may have escaped Western military intervention had it kept its nuclear weapons programme.\\nKim Kye-gwan said in his statement that this was \"not an expression of intention to address the issue through dialogue\".\\n\"It is essentially a manifestation of awfully sinister moves to impose on our dignified state the destiny of Libya or Iraq which had been collapsed due to yielding the whole of their countries to big powers.\\n\"We do not hide our feeling of repugnance towards [Bolton].\"\\nMr Kim also warns Mr Trump that if he \"follows in the footsteps of his predecessors\" - refusing to engage with North Korea unless it gives up its nuclear weapons - \"he will be recorded as more tragic and unsuccessful president than his predecessors, far from his initial ambition to make unprecedented success\".' target:0\n",
      "features:b'The talks that opened this week between the North and South Korean governments are off to an inauspicious start: Even before negotiators could settle into their seats, the North had pocketed its first concession from the South, offering nothing in return.\\nNorth Korean negotiators are practiced hands in the art of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe win and you lose\\xe2\\x80\\x9d deal-making. Unless the team of President Moon Jae-in of South Korea has the fortitude to stand up to such ploys and has a solid game plan of its own, there is a serious risk that the South, its allies and much of the international community will come out of these apparent peace overtures even less secure than before.\\nThe upcoming North-South dialogue was decreed by Kim Jong-un in his New Year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Day address, after two years of brushing off diplomatic feelers from Seoul. Mr. Kim declared that now \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as in, right now \\xe2\\x80\\x94 was the time for the two sides to meet to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimprove the relations between themselves and take decisive measures for achieving a breakthrough for independent reunification without being obsessed by bygone days.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Seoul rushed to accommodate Mr. Kim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s timetable.\\nThe North\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sudden move ostensibly is explained by its desire to participate in the Winter Olympics next month, which will be hosted in South Korea. But those games were awarded back in 2011, and Mr. Kim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s New Year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech is an important annual ritual, prepared and polished months in advance.\\nBy springing this surprise right before the start of the event, the North imposed a hurried and artificial deadline for results. This is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe say jump, you ask how high\\xe2\\x80\\x9d diplomacy in action \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which is effective for showing who is in control of the negotiation process. Sometimes it also pushes adversaries into making unforced errors.\\nThe South Korean government, in its haste to make ready for dialogue with the North, almost immediately wrong-footed itself. It pre-emptively proposed delaying the joint annual United States-South Korean winter military exercises until after the Games. (Washington acquiesced after high-level consultations.) Seoul may have intended this gesture in the spirit of good will or magnanimity, but it sent all the wrong signals \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including a willingness that may be read as weakness, and could harden Pyongyang\\xe2\\x80\\x99s posture, raising its expectations for what it might be able to take back home. The South Korean government, in other words, is off to a bad start, at least tactically.\\nAs far as strategy goes, it is absolutely critical for Seoul \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but also for the international community \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to understand what may be the calculations underlying Mr. Kim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s move. In particular: Why did he propose talks with only South Korea? And why now?\\nThe simplest interpretation may be that Pyongyang regards South Korea as the weakest link in the gathering global campaign to pressure North Korea to denuclearize.\\nMoon Jae-in, South Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new and immensely popular president, is a progressive from a camp that favors so-called sunshine policies, and fervently aspires to reconciliation with North Korea through d\\xc3\\xa9tente, economic engagement and increasing interdependence. But those policies have a checkered track record.\\nIn 2000, their first major proponent, the former president and Nobel Peace laureate Kim Dae-jung, secretly and illegally paid Kim Jong-il, North Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leader at the time, hundreds of millions of dollars to secure a summit. Roh Moo-hyun, the next South Korean president, later strained relations with the United States by trying to take on a balancing role between Washington and Pyongyang \\xe2\\x80\\x94 playing arbiter, in other words, between the ally committed to Seoul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s military protection and the regime committed to Seoul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s destruction.\\nTo his credit, in his short time in office Mr. Moon \\xe2\\x80\\x94 who, by the way, was one of Mr. Roh\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top advisers during those troubled years \\xe2\\x80\\x94 has leavened his own sunshine yearnings with a strong dose of realpolitik. He has pushed for missile defense, for example, as well as for close coordination over international sanctions with the United States despite new strains with President Trump. Last week, Mr. Moon is reported to have said of the upcoming talks with North Korea, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will not just na\\xc3\\xafvely push for dialogue as in the past.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nStill, Pyongyang seems to have kept in reserve the option of going on a charm offensive with him. It has already dismissed President Trump as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdotard.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It called Barack Obama a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwicked black monkey.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It cursed Park Geun-hye, the previous president of South Korea, as an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cold, insane bitch.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But it has had nothing bad to say about Mr. Moon (yet).\\nMeanwhile, the urgency of the North\\xe2\\x80\\x99s diplomatic drive can be explained by both recent wins and menacing losses ahead. Over the past several years, Pyongyang has tested atomic bombs \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and, it claims, one hydrogen device \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and has launched intercontinental missiles. According to Mr. Kim, the United States mainland is now \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwithin range of our nuclear strike\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and his defense sector is moving to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmass produce\\xe2\\x80\\x9d nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles.\\nAll the same, the North\\xe2\\x80\\x99s military rests on an economic base that is not only tiny, but also notoriously dysfunctional and desperately dependent on foreign resources and so uniquely vulnerable to serious sanctions. The United Nations Security Council has voted for new and potentially crippling penalties. China \\xe2\\x80\\x94 North Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s main financial backer \\xe2\\x80\\x94 appears finally ready to reconsider, and reduce, its support.\\nTo date, at least by outward appearance, the North Korean economy has not been much fazed by international sanctions. But we do not know how fast the North is spending down its reserves. Only Mr. Kim does.\\nIf Mr. Kim is indeed in a race against the clock to forestall economic disaster at home, importuning Seoul to help lift (or at least ignore) international sanctions, relax nuclear counter-proliferation efforts and revive sunshine economic programs could be the most expeditious way to get out of a bind.\\nSo how can the Moon administration avoid getting played? First, by recognizing the North\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ulterior goals in these talks, and the other traps it may be readying. Then, by insisting ruthlessly on a quid pro quo at every step \\xe2\\x80\\x94 requiring, for example, that if Seoul postpones military exercises, then Pyongyang should too. And finally, by tucking a few tricks up its own sleeves.\\nMr. Kim says he wants more contact between the North and the South? Insist on it, including by requiring that news from South Korea be allowed to reach the North. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t shy away from raising unpleasant topics, like North Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appalling human rights situation, and calling for it to cooperate with the existing United Nations commission of inquiry. And why not confidentially mention that a large majority of South Koreans now seem to favor hosting United States tactical nuclear weapons to counter the North\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new threats?\\nSouth Korean negotiators are not used to turning the tables on their North Korean interlocutors, but they should start.' target:-1\n",

And while President Reuven Rivlin called Tuesday night for the two top parties to form a national unity government, both rejected the idea.\\nNetanyahu now looks much better positioned to build a right-wing nationalist government that would allow him to govern unfettered by the wide ideological differences that doomed his previous coalition.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear friends, against all odds, we got a great victory for the Likud party,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said in a jubilant election night speech at Likud headquarters in Tel Aviv, to chants of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBibi! Bibi! Bibi!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe fiercely fought campaign, which just days before the election seemed headed toward a major political upheaval, was in many ways a referendum on Netanyahu.

But the political and social cost \\xe2\\x80\\x93 never mind the $60 million price-tag of holding elections \\xe2\\x80\\x93 remains to be seen. Once the confetti settles, and Netanyahu turns to the task of actually trying to rule a deeply fractured country besieged by enemies, he will be facing many of the same challenges \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but with few fresh ideas, and perhaps fewer friends.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was very disappointed with the fact that there was no real discussion about the issues,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Speaker of the Knesset Yuli Edelstein of the Likud party told reporters Tuesday night in Tel Aviv. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was probably one of the lowest campaigns we had, and we wasted the opportunity as a country and a society, because when exactly are we going to discuss the real issues if not during an election campaign?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nNetanyahu called early elections last fall after firing two of his coalition partners, Finance Minister Yair Lapid of the Yesh Atid party and Justice Minister Tzipi Livni of the Hatnua party. He argued that he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t govern effectively with such an ideological gap. One of the divisive issues was the coalition parties' opposition to a bill that would have formally identified Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people, a move some saw as undermining its democratic nature and marginalizing the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 20 percent Arab population.\\nAt the time, another Netanyahu victory seemed a pretty sure bet. But Ms. Livni\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to partner with the Labor party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Isaac Herzog gave the prime minister a run for his money, attracting voters with their more moderate position on Palestinians as well as their commitment to socioeconomic issues. As of the final polls last Friday, they were projected to win by three to four seats.\\nSo Netanyahu, widely recognized even by his foes as a shrewd politician, abruptly switched tack. After weeks of promoting himself as the only leader who could protect Israel against Iran, Hamas, and the Islamic State, he started talking about the things that were hurting Likud\\xe2\\x80\\x99s traditional blue-collar base \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the skyrocketing cost of housing and groceries. He vowed to appoint as finance minister Moshe Kahlon of the Kulanu party, a former Likudnik from a humble background whose monopoly-busting policies reduced charges for cellphone plans by 90 percent.\\nNetanyahu also openly cannibalized votes from estranged right-wing allies like Naftali Bennett\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Jewish Home party and Avigdor Lieberman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Israel Beitenu. A day before the vote, he declared that there would be no Palestinian state on his watch, reneging on a 2009 pledge of support for the two-state solution to the Middle East conflict.\\nThat puts him on a collision course with the Obama administration, which is already fuming over his bombastic speech to Congress two weeks ago in which he criticized a potential Iran nuclear deal. But the reversal appears to have played well with his base.\\nAs early indications Tuesday showed an uptick in Israeli Arab voter turnout, Netanyahu warned his supporters that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cArab voters are coming out in droves to the polls,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d putting a right-wing government in danger if they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get out of their homes and vote.\\nWhen exit polls came in Tuesday night, it was clear that his tactics had paid off. All three Israeli TV news channels showed him pulling even with the Zionist Camp led by Mr. Herzog and Ms. Livni, with each party getting 27 of the Knesset\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 120 seats and one poll putting Likud at 28.\\nBut only Wednesday morning was the full picture clear. With 99 percent of the votes counted, Likud is projected to get 30 seats to the Zionist Camp\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 24. Its victory came at the expense of estranged Netanyahu allies. Mr. Bennett, a rising star in the last elections, had to settle for eight seats; Mr. Lieberman was relegated to a record-low of six. Mr. Lapid of Yesh Atid, who as a rookie in 2013 captured 19 seats, also suffered and was downsized to 11.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe had an atmosphere of a neck-and-neck race, and when you have such an atmosphere we know that \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 first of all you increase the turnout,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Abraham Diskin, a political scientist and former statistician for the Central Elections Committee. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSecond, the two really leading parties are gaining power from the satellite parties, and that \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 really happened here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe two ultra-Orthodox parties, Shas and United Torah Judaism, got seven and six, respectively, and could well become coalition partners for Netanyahu.

The Obamas directed that, rather than receive a refund, the overpayment will be applied to their taxes for next year.\\nThe Obamas also claimed $39,875 in income from outside the United States. A White House official said all of that income came from book royalties, but did not disclose details about which countries the income came from. The official was not authorized to comment publicly on Obama&aposs taxes and spoke on condition of anonymity.\\nThe president and first lady reported donating $150,034 -- or 24.6 percent of their income -- to 33 charities. That&aposs a slight dip from the previous year, when the Obamas donated more than $172,000. The largest contribution last year was a $103,871 donation to Fisher House Foundation, which provides humanitarian services to military members, veterans and their families. Other charitable groups that received donations from the president for $5,000 or less include the American Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity, Boys & Girls Clubs of America and the United Negro College Fund.\\nThe president and the first lady also paid $29,450 in income taxes to Illinois, according to their state tax returns.\\nThe White House also released tax returns for Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill Biden. The Bidens paid $87,851 in federal income taxes on $385,072 in adjusted gross income, for an effective federal tax rate of 22.8 percent. The vice president and his wife paid state income taxes in two states -- $13,531 in Delaware and $3,593 in Virginia. They reported donating $7,190 to charity.' target:1\n",
      "features:b'WASHINGTON \\xe2\\x80\\x93 A divided appeals court panel sided Friday with Ohio business owners who challenged the birth control mandate under the new federal health care law.\\nThe business owners are two brothers, Francis and Philip M. Gilardi, who own Freshway Foods and Freshway Logistics of Sidney, Ohio., and challenged the mandate on religious grounds. They say the mandate to provide contraceptive coverage would force them to violate their Roman Catholic beliefs and moral values by providing contraceptives such as the morning-after pill for their employees. The law already exempts houses of worship from the requirement.\\nThe ruling by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is one of several on the birth control issue, which likely will be resolved by the Supreme Court. There are at least three other rulings by federal appeals courts on the mandate: One sided with Oklahoma businesses; and two sided with the Obama administration in challenges brought by Pennsylvania and Michigan companies.\\nWriting for the majority, Judge Janice Rogers Brown wrote that the mandate \"trammels the right of free exercise--a right that lies at the core of our constitutional liberties--as protected by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\"\\nBrown, an appointee of President George W. Bush, said that the mandate presented the Gilardis with a \"Hobson&aposs choice: They can either abide by the sacred tenets of their faith, pay a penalty of over $14 million, and cripple the companies they have spent a lifetime building, or they become complicit in a grave moral wrong.\"\\nFriday&aposs ruling reversed a lower court ruling that had denied the Gilardis&apos request for a preliminary injunction to block the Department of Health and Human Services from enforcing the mandate against them as business owners. The appeals court ruled that the lower court erred when it concluded the Gilardis were unlikely to succeed on the merits, and sent the case back to the lower court to consider other factors for an injunction.\\nBut Brown upheld the lower court&aposs dismissal of an injunction for the brothers&apos companies, writing, \"we have no basis for concluding a secular organization can exercise religion.\"\\nIn an opinion dissenting from the court&aposs main holding in the case, Judge Harry T. Edwards wrote that legislative restrictions may trump religious exercise. He asked what, if the Gilardis&apos companies were exempted from covering contraception, would stop another company from seeking an exemption from a requirement to cover vaccines?\\n\"The mandate does not require the Gilardis to encourage Freshway&aposs employees to use contraceptives any more directly than they do by authorizing Freshway to pay wages,\" wrote Edwards, who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter. He added that the Gilardis remain free to publicly express their disapproval of contraceptives.\\nComing from the other direction, Judge A. Raymond Randolph joined Brown&aposs main conclusion about the Gilardis but dissented from her conclusions about Freshway companies&apos exercise of religion.\\n\"Why limit the free-exercise right to religious organizations when many business corporations adhere to religious dogma?\" asked Randolph, an appointee of President George H.W. Bush. \"If non-religious organizations do not have free-exercise rights, why do non-religious natural persons (atheists, for example) possess them?\"\\nThe Gilardis&apos lawyer, Francis Manion, senior counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice, an anti-abortion legal group that focuses on constitutional law, said he was pleased that the court accepted the \"bulk\" of his arguments, but will appeal the part of the ruling on the free exercise religious rights of corporations.\\n\"It&aposs a big victory, but not total,\" he said in a telephone interview.\\nIn a statement, the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United, a church-state watchdog group, said the Friday&aposs ruling turns \"the concept of religious freedom on its head.\\n\"Religious liberty means the right to make decisions for yourself, not other people,\" Lynn said. \"Freedom of religion should never be a blank check to meddle in the personal medical decisions of others.\"\\nThe Department of Health and Human Services said it was unable to comment on pending litigation.' target:1\n",

      "features:b'Tegotego / Dreamstime.comA federal judge has made it very clear in a new ruling that the government can force you to send your kids to school, but you can\\'t force the government to actually provide an education there.\\nJudge Stephen Murphy III of the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division, just dismissed a case originating from Detroit accusing Gov. Rick Snyder and other state officials of doing such a terrible job when the then-bankrupt city was under the control of emergency managers that they deprived students of a right to an education or even basic literacy.\\nThe plaintiffs argued that this extremely crappy non-education violated their Due Process and Equal Protection rights under the 14th Amendment. The State of Michigan argued that this complaint\\xe2\\x80\\x94a demand for \"access to literacy\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94is not constitutionally recognized. The judge agreed, though he very much sympathized with the students, and dismissed the case.\\nWhile the dismissal is prompting some outrage (and the plaintiffs promise to appeal) it should not come as a surprise. The courts have been extremely reluctant to wade into any space where they define what sort of an education anybody has a \"right\" to, though they\\'ve certainly been fine with the government forcing kids to attend regardless. A Supreme Court case from 1973, San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, held that the U.S. Constitution did not establish a \"fundamental right to education.\"\\nBut that ruling was about equal access to educational tools and funding mechanisms. The San Antonio case was about whether it was constitutional to use property taxes as a school funding mechanism if it meant that students in poorer communities got worse educations than those in wealthier communities (answer: yes). In this case, Murphy noted, the plaintiffs are simply arguing that they aren\\'t getting any sort of education at all. Was that a distinctly different enough argument for Murphy to contradict pervious precedents? Is basic \"access to literacy\" a fundamental right?\\nIn the end, the judge ruled it was not:\\nHe noted previous examples where courts have ruled that there\\'s no fundamental right to water or sewer service and that the Due Process Clause does not compel the state to protect a child from an abusive father or from a bully in school.\\nSo even when the government has the authority to mandate behaviors of the citizens under the law, it\\'s a one-way street. The judge ruled that the state cannot be affirmatively ordered to provide students even the basic level of education to achieve literacy.\\nThis is not to say the judge\\'s ruling is wrong. If the courts did rule that schools were constitutionally mandated to provide a certain level of education, imagine the lawsuits that would follow as everybody attempted to make the case for how that level of education should be determined. We already have a constant culture war within the education system itself about what schools are supposed to be teaching. The last thing we need is for the courts to get dragged into figuring out those boundaries.\\nBut what people should take away from this ruling is the importance of competition and choice in forcing schools to improve. If the courts can\\'t make a school provide a certain level of education, parents and students must be free to pick other schools. Education must be a marketplace. A court can\\'t order a grocery store to sell certain products, but they know that if they don\\'t provide what customers need somebody else will and they\\'ll lose business. Schools should be the same way. And there\\'s evidence to show that when there\\'s charter schools and other school choice options around, public schools start to improve.\\nIf the courts lack the authority to force schools to provide a certain level of education, we should make sure that parents have access to school choice to decide what\\'s best for their own kids.' target:1\n",

      "features:b'President Donald Trump departs Friday for his first foreign trip, a nine-day voyage that will take him across the Middle East and Western Europe. Although the trip will be shadowed by Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growing problems at home, it could shape his foreign policy in important and lasting ways.\\nTrump will encounter a slew of thorny foreign policy issues on his trip, which features stops in Saudi Arabia, Israel, a G7 meeting in Sicily, a NATO summit in Brussels and a visit to the Vatican.\\nStory Continued Below\\nHere are five things to watch:\\n1\\\\. Will he say \"radical Islamic terrorism\"?\\nDuring his first stop in Saudi Arabia, Trump will give a speech focused on Islam and terrorism. He might come in with rhetorical guns blazing. Trump once said that Saudi Arabia \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblew up the World Trade Center\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and has accused it and other Gulf Arab states of supporting terrorism. He said in March 2016 that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIslam hates us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut fans of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tough talk may be disappointed. His Saudi hosts, and the Muslim leaders who will gather in Riyadh for a summit while Trump is there, would be infuriated by such rhetoric from their guest. They will be expecting a more temperate message in the vein of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s predecessors, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who argued that Islam is a religion of peace and that the United States is not at war with the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Muslims. In a briefing last week, national security adviser H.R. McMaster said Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech would be \\xe2\\x80\\x9crespectful.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nOne thing to watch is whether Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s address uses the phrase \\xe2\\x80\\x9cradical Islamic terrorism.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d McMaster has urged Trump to avoid using that phrase, which Trump often repeated as a candidate but which Obama and Bush both avoided because it offends many Muslims. Trump has used the construction publicly at least twice since McMaster took the job in February\\xe2\\x80\\x94though McMaster hinted at a possible compromise during a briefing at the White House last week, when he said Trump would speak about \\xe2\\x80\\x9cradical Islamist ideology,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which he said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cuses a perverted interpretation of Islam to justify crimes against all humanity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n2\\\\. Will he play Middle East peacemaker?\\nTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s second stop will be in Israel. The visit itself will draw an implicit contrast with Obama, who had testy relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and who did not stop in Israel during his first visit to the Middle East in 2009. Despite the controversy over whether Trump shared classified intelligence provided by Israel with Russian officials in the Oval Office last week, a bigger focus of his visit will be the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Trump insists he wants to broker a historic agreement between the two sides, despite decades of failed efforts to reach one\\xe2\\x80\\x94and despite wariness among Israeli officials that Trump might want a deal more than they do.\\nClose observers of the region will be watching not only Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interactions with Netanyahu but also with the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas. Trump has a meeting with Abbas planned, but a key question is whether he will convene Abbas and Netanyahu in an effort to jump-start peace talks that have been dormant for three years. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWill there be a three-way Trump-Bibi-Abbas meeting\\xe2\\x80\\x94and if so will there be any announced understandings from it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Dennis Ross, a former Middle East policy adviser to several presidents.\\n3\\\\. Does he really support NATO?\\nTrump spent much of the 2016 campaign criticizing NATO. Many European leaders were relieved to hear Trump say in an April press conference with Italy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prime minster that the 28-member military alliance is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno longer obsolete.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But Trump said that in response to what he says is NATO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new attention to terrorism, which in fact remains a secondary mission for the alliance.\\nWhat Trump has still not done as president is affirm NATO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role as a guarantor of European security\\xe2\\x80\\x94particularly against Russia, the country NATO was formed to defend against. Trump has also not committed to observe the part of the treaty that commits every member to defend one another against aggression. During the campaign, Trump suggested that the United States might not come to the defense of a NATO member that had not met its budgetary commitments to the organization. (Most NATO members spend less on defense than they have pledged.)\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo me the big question is if he endorses the original mission, which he hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t done,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thomas Wright, director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution.\\n4\\\\. Can he stick to a script?\\nLongtime Trump watchers are keen to see how he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll handle the many opportunities to stray from the script prepared for him by McMaster and other national security professionals. A shoot-from-the-hip president on a long and tiring first trip out of the country is a recipe for multiple missteps, gaffes and comments that could send confusing messages about U.S. policy. Distracted by a barrage of controversies at home, including Wednesday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appointment of a special prosecutor to probe Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s involvement in the 2016 election, Trump has had little time to focus on the briefing materials his staff has prepared for him. Events like G7 and NATO meetings are typically choreographed affairs in which everyone knows what everyone else will say in advance, but no one is sure just what to expect from Trump.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is not a president who tends to follow the script,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Charles Kupchan, a Georgetown University professor who served as the Obama National Security Council\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top aide for Europe. Anytime Trump meets with a foreign leader, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Kupchan said.\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s even more likely in multilateral meetings like the ones Trump will attend next week, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhen everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just kind of speaking extemporaneously,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Kupchan said.\\n5\\\\. Can he change the subject?\\nPresidents have long savored the opportunity to skip town at times of domestic trouble and drag a captive White House press corps through foreign meetings where the commander in chief is treated like a potentate. Regardless of a president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approval ratings at home, foreign officials always welcome an American leader with camera-friendly pomp and circumstance.\\nBut presidents often find that a change of scenery isn\\'t enough. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really change the subject,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one former senior Obama White House official who recalled long trips abroad in which White House reporters cared less about Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interactions with foreign leaders than about controversies brewing back in Washington. Obama and his aides spent much of a November 2012 trip to Asia, for instance, fielding questions about a looming fiscal crisis in Washington that overshadowed his diplomatic message. On another Asia trip in the fall of 2015, Obama parried tough questions about GOP criticism of his policy toward the Islamic State and Muslim refugees. (It is unclear how often Trump will field questions from the reporters traveling with him\\xe2\\x80\\x94or whether he will at all.)\\nThe good news for Trump is that the particulars of his first foreign trip will attract more play-by-play attention than most presidential jaunts. The bad news is that the easiest way to change the subject from his headaches at home is to commit a gaffe that adds to his mounting woes.' target:-1\n",

      "features:b'Trending\\nThomas Sowell\\nLessons From the Past\\nDennis Prager\\nWhy Is There a War on Cheerleaders?\\nKurt Schlichter\\nWhat Will It Take To Make You Understand And Accept That They Hate You?\\nTuesday should be a very good day for Donald Trump. Voters in Connecticut, Maryland, Rhode Island, Delaware and Pennsylvania will take part in selecting 172 delegates to the Republican national convention. Trump is widely expected to win all five contests and win between 98 and 123 of the 172 delegates at stake.\\nBut, because such a great performance is already built into projections, winning these delegates will not increase Trump\\'s chances of wrapping up the nomination. My latest estimates at Styrk.com show that Trump could end up with just enough delegates to secure the nomination. He could also fall up to 140 delegates short. The only news on Tuesday that would significantly alter that assessment would be if the frontrunner has a surprisingly bad night and earns less than 98 delegates. I can\\'t imagine that happening. If it does, however, Trump\\'s chances of winning the nomination would decline significantly.\\nIn practical terms, then, the race for the Republican nomination will be determined by the 10 races left after Tuesday\\'s competition. That\\'s why Indiana will be such an important test when it votes next week. Nobody knows whether Trump or Cruz will win that state. If Trump wins Indiana, he is probably set to do well in remaining contests. \"If Cruz wins Indiana, that could signal a shift leading to Trump losing up to 8 of the 10 remaining contests.\"\\nThere is one ironic footnote to the Northeastern Primary. The very process that Trump claims is rigged against him will once again work to his benefit. His share of the delegates won on Tuesday will almost certainly exceed his share of the vote. Up to this point, Trump has earned 28 percent more delegates than his pro rata share of the vote would deem appropriate.\\nCARTOONS | AF Branco\\nView Cartoon\\nOf the 172 delegates at stake tomorrow, 118 will be formally pledged to a candidate. Trump should win between 98 and 106 of these delegates. That\\'s because three of the five states are either a winner-take-all contest (Delaware) or a winner-take-all by Congressional District approach (Connecticut, Maryland). Trump may win all 82 delegates in these states. At the low end of expectations, he could lose one to three Congressional Districts costing him three to nine delegates.\\nOn top of that, Trump can probably count on the 17 Pennsylvania delegates awarded to the statewide winner.\\nRecommended\\nLessons From the Past\\nThomas Sowell\\nIn Rhode Island, delegates are awarded proportionally. So, if Trump gets roughly half the vote, he\\'ll get roughly half of it\\'s 19 delegates.\\nThe remaining 54 delegates at stake in the Northeastern Primary are from Pennsylvania. They are elected directly (i.e.-- people vote for the delegate, not the presidential candidate). Some of those delegates have pledged to vote for either the statewide winner or the winner of their Congressional District. The rest will be pure free agents. Trump will almost certainly win some of these delegates, but how many is unknown.\\nWhen you add it all up, Trump is likely to win less than 50 percent of the vote on Tuesday, but end up with between 57 percent and 72 percent of the delegates.\\nBut the key to understanding the Northeastern Primary day is remembering that it probably won\\'t tell us much more than we already know. The real action will take place in the ten states that vote after Tuesday.' target:1\n",
      "features:b'President announces efforts to move U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\\nPresident Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s capital is a perfect response to President Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s benighted decision to change American policy by engineering the United Nations Security Council Resolution declaring Judaism\\xe2\\x80\\x99s holiest places in Jerusalem to be occupied territory and a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cflagrant violation under international law.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It was President Obama who changed the status quo and made peace more difficult, by handing the Palestinians enormous leverage in future negotiations and disincentivizing them from making a compromised peace.\\nIt had long been American foreign policy to veto any one-sided Security Council resolutions that declared Judaism\\xe2\\x80\\x99s holiest places to be illegally occupied. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to change that policy was not based on American interests or in the interests of peace. It was done out of personal revenge against Prime Minister Netanyahu and an act of pique by the outgoing president.\\nIt was also designed improperly to tie the hands of President-elect Trump. President Trump is doing the right thing by telling the United Nations that the United States now rejects the one-sided U.N. Security Council Resolution.\\nSo if there is any change to the status quo, let the blame lie where it should be: at the hands of President Obama for his cowardly decision to wait until he was a lame-duck president to get even with Prime Minister Netanyahu. President Trump deserves praise for restoring balance in negotiations with Israel and the Palestinians. It was President Obama who made peace more difficult. It was President Trump who made it more feasible again.\\nThe outrageously one-sided Security Council Resolution declared that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cany changes to the 4 June 1967 lines, including with regard to Jerusalem,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d have \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This means, among other things, that Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to build a plaza for prayer at the Western Wall \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Judaism\\xe2\\x80\\x99s holiest site \\xe2\\x80\\x94 constitutes a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cflagrant violation of international law.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This resolution was, therefore, not limited to settlements in the West Bank, as the Obama administration later claimed in a bait-and-switch. The resolution applied equally to the very heart of Israel.\\nBefore June 4, 1967, Jews were forbidden from praying at the Western Wall, Judaism\\xe2\\x80\\x99s holiest site. They were forbidden to attend classes at the Hebrew University at Mt. Scopus, which had been opened in 1925 and was supported by Albert Einstein. Jews could not seek medical care at the Hadassah Hospital on Mt. Scopus, which had treated Jews and Arabs alike since 1918. Jews could not live in the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem, where their forbearers had built homes and synagogues for thousands of years. These Judenrein prohibitions were enacted by Jordan, which had captured by military force these Jewish areas during Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s War of Independence, in 1948, and had illegally occupied the entire West Bank, which the United Nations had set aside for an Arab state. When the Jordanian government occupied these historic Jewish sites, they destroyed all the remnants of Judaism, including synagogues, schools and cemeteries, whose headstones they used for urinals. Between 1948 and 1967, the United Nations did not offer a single resolution condemning this Jordanian occupation and cultural devastation.\\nWhen Israel retook these areas in a defensive war that Jordan started by shelling civilian homes in West Jerusalem, and opened them up as places where Jews could pray, study, receive medical treatment and live, the United States took the official position that it would not recognize Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legitimate claims to Jewish Jerusalem.\\nIt stated that the status of Jerusalem, including these newly liberated areas, would be left open to final negotiations and that the status quo would remain in place. That is the official rationale for why the United States refused to recognize any part of Jerusalem, including West Jerusalem, as part of Israel. That is why the United States refused to allow an American citizen born in any part of Jerusalem to put the words \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJerusalem, Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on his or her passport as their place of birth.\\nBut even that historic status quo was changed with President Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unjustified decision not to veto the Security Council Resolution from last December. The United Nations all of a sudden determined that, subject to any further negotiations and agreements, the Jewish areas of Jerusalem recaptured from Jordan in 1967 are not part of Israel. Instead, they were territories being illegally occupied by Israel, and any building in these areas \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including places for prayer at the Western Wall, access roads to Mt. Scopus, and synagogues in the historic Jewish Quarter \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconstitutes a flagrant violation under international law.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d If that indeed is the new status quo, then what incentives do the Palestinians have to enter negotiations? And if they were to do so, they could use these Jewish areas to extort unreasonable concessions from Israel, for which these now \\xe2\\x80\\x9cillegally occupied\\xe2\\x80\\x9d areas are sacred and nonnegotiable.\\nPresident Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s refusal to veto this one-sided resolution was a deliberate ploy to tie the hands of his successors, the consequence of which was to make it far more difficult for his successors to encourage the Palestinians to accept Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offer to negotiate with no preconditions. No future president can undo this pernicious agreement, since a veto not cast can never be retroactively cast. And a resolution once enacted cannot be rescinded unless there is a majority vote against it, with no veto by any of its permanent members, which include Russia and China, who would be sure to veto any attempt to undo this resolution.\\nPresident Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to officially recognize Jerusalem as Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s capital helps to restore the appropriate balance. It demonstrates that the United States does not accept the Judenrein effects of this bigoted resolution on historic Jewish areas of Jerusalem, which were forbidden to Jews. The prior refusal of the United States to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s capital was based explicitly on the notion that nothing should be done to change the status quo of that city, holy to three religions. But the Security Council Resolution did exactly that: It changed the status quo by declaring Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s de facto presence on these Jewish holy sites to be a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cflagrant violation under international law\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe U.N. will not recognize.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSince virtually everyone in the international community acknowledges that any reasonable peace would recognize Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legitimate claims to these and other areas in Jerusalem, there is no reason for allowing the U.N. Resolution to make criminals out of every Jew or Israeli who sets foot on these historically Jewish areas. (Ironically, President Obama prayed at what he regarded as the illegally occupied Western Wall.)\\nAfter the UN, at the urging of President Obama, made it a continuing international crime for there to be any Israeli presence in disputed areas of Jerusalem, including areas whose Jewish provenance is beyond dispute, President Trump was right to untie his own hands and to undo the damage wrought by his predecessor. Some have argued that the United States should not recognize Jerusalem because it will stimulate violence by Arab terrorists. No American decision should ever be influenced by the threat of violence. Terrorists should not have a veto over American policy. If the United States were to give in to threat of violence, it would only incentivize others to threaten violence in response to any peace plan.\\nSo let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s praise President Trump for doing the right thing by undoing the wrong thing President Obama did at the end of his presidency.' target:1\n",

      "features:b'Key parts of the PATRIOT Act expired at midnight after a bitterly divided Senate adjourned after failing to reach agreement during a rare Sunday session to extend the anti-terrorism law.\\nThe Senate did vote overwhelmingly to advance the USA Freedom Act, a House-passed surveillance reform bill that GOP leaders opposed but were forced to accept given the lack of time and other alternatives. But Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) refused to allow that measure to be adopted in time to replace the expiring PATRIOT Act provisions.\\nStory Continued Below\\nThe USA Freedom Act easily cleared a filibuster in a 77-17 vote that appeared to set the stage for eventual passage. But it was not the outcome envisioned by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell: He had hoped to pass a temporary extension of current law to avoid a midnight shutdown of three PATRIOT Act programs, including the controversial \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbulk data\\xe2\\x80\\x9d phone record collection program.\\nBut Paul wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t relent, so those initiatives have at least temporarily lapsed, a troubling development for Senate Republicans in just their fifth month in the majority.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll of us are extremely concerned about the program going dark at a time when the terrorist threat is very high,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine).\\nThe Senate will vote next to end debate Tuesday on the House bill and on amendments intended to make it more palatable to Senate hawks. Those will likely extend a transition period to the new bill beyond six months and require additional certifications to the reformed data collection program.\\nUntil then, three surveillance authorities will be nullified. And the House will still have to reconcile with the Senate over any changes later this week.\\nMcConnell has already submitted a set of amendments to the measure. One relatively uncontroversial proposal, submitted with Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.), would require telecommunications companies to notify the government if they plan to hold onto call records for less than 18 months. Another would to require the director of national intelligence to certify that the new process for obtaining business records effectively protects national security.\\nBut other amendments may face significant resistance in the Senate and House, including a provision that would give the NSA six more months to wind down its bulk phone records collection program, and another that would gut the bill\\xe2\\x80\\x99s effort to make public any significant opinions from the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\\nAll four are slated to get a vote after the Senate votes to end debate Tuesday, leaving the bill for now on the doorstep of success but not a done deal, even as Washington clamors for a swift resolution.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe call on the Senate to ensure this irresponsible lapse in authorities is as short-lived as possible,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said White House press secretary Josh Earnest. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndividual senators must put aside their partisan motivations and act swiftly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nPaul seemed unconcerned: Through his presidential campaign, he said his successful, if temporary, victory \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwill not relinquish functions necessary for protecting national security.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nA visibly angry McConnell made a last-ditch attempt to keep the expiring provisions on life support on Sunday evening. He moved to extend for two weeks less controversial wire-tapping and \\xe2\\x80\\x9clone wolf\\xe2\\x80\\x9d terrorist provisions, only to be rebuffed by his Kentucky colleague. Responding on the Senate floor, McConnell ripped what he called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdemagoguery\\xe2\\x80\\x9d surrounding the PATRIOT Act debate.\\nThough McConnell had pressed Republicans to oppose the House bill earlier last month, he said the alternative \\xe2\\x80\\x94 letting the PATRIOT Act provisions expire \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwould mean disarming completely and arbitrarily, based on a campaign of disinformation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a totally unacceptable outcome. We won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be doing that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d McConnell said, staring at Paul at times during the stern speech, which was interrupted by Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrozen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d phone ringtone. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re left with Option 2, the House-passed bill.

Paul acknowledged that the bill will eventually pass despite his opposition even as he asserted that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe PATRIOT Act will expire tonight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt concerns me that the president [who] supports bulk data collection and has been performing it illegally for six years is supporting this bill,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Paul said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard for me to have trust in the people we are giving great power to.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMcConnell laid out out his strategy during a closed-door Republican meeting on Sunday afternoon. He indicated he would try to fix what he believes are problems with the House bill, which would make telecom companies responsible for bulk data collection.\\nPaul was not present at the party meeting, and it was clear his colleagues were tiring of the presidential candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign against swift passage of any surveillance legislation. Before he objected to McConnell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s last-ditch effort, Paul was shouted down by his fellow Republicans as he attempted to give another speech against government surveillance.\\nAnd McConnell lashed the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdetermined opposition from those who simply wish to end this counterterrorism program altogether\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a clear reference to Paul, the leader of that opposition.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worrying for our country. Because the nature of the threat we face is serious, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aggressive, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sophisticated, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s geographically dispersed, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going away,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d McConnell said.\\nSources said the USA Freedom Act, with or without amendments, could be approved as early as Tuesday or Wednesday even if Paul continues his fight. But McConnell had vowed not to let the programs lapse, hoping that the June 1 deadline would pressure the Senate to act as he pushed trade legislation through the Senate first.\\nIn reaction to McConnell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quandary, Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) blasted his successor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leadership of the Senate, including his decision to wait to take up the PATRIOT Act until just before its key provisions were set to expire.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe job of the leader is to have a plan. In this case, it is clear the majority leader simply didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a plan,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Reid said on the Senate floor. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe majority leader, though, had five months during the time he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been majority leader to coordinate with the House, which passed (surveillance) reform weeks ago, but instead he went it alone. In fact, it appears as if the House and the Senate Republican leaders are on completely different pages.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIndeed, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), who shepherded a surveillance reform bill through the House by an overwhelming margin earlier this month, urged McConnell to take up the USA Freedom Act on Sunday night.\\nBurr, the Intelligence Committee chairman and an ally of McConnell, predicted the House bill would pass but \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot in its current form.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nTempers flared as the debate unfolded. Senators were called back to Washington early from their Memorial Day vacation to address the issue, and most of their ire was directed at Paul.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe way we work in the Senate, at least we used to, is we have compromises. And compromises may have to be made,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) of McConnell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s change of position on the House bill. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is not Sen. Paul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s M.O.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nPaul has been asking McConnell to allow him to have two votes on his privacy amendments, including one that would kill bulk data collection altogether, at simple majority thresholds rather than at a 60-vote threshold. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a demand most senators will not agree to.

Democrats made several efforts to obtain Trump&aposs returns while in the minority, only to be rejected by House Republicans.\\nTrump would likely seek to stall those requests with legal challenges, and it remains unclear whether Democrats could publicly release his tax returns even if they obtained them for investigative purposes.\\nBefore a rally in Indiana on Monday, Trump brushed off the threat. \"I don&apost care,\" he said. \"They can do whatever they want, and I can do whatever I want.\"\\nRep. Jerry Nadler, the Democrat who was projected to win New York&aposs 10th congressional district, warned Trump in a tweet his administration would be \"held accountable.\"\\n\"Tonight, the American people have demanded accountability from their government and sent a clear message of what they want from Congress,\" he wrote.

In September, a federal judge ruled that Democrats have standing to sue Trump over potential violations of the Constitution&aposs Emoluments Clause, which ostensibly precludes the president from accepting certain foreign favors. While the legal argument that Trump is violating this clause by maintaining lucrative and profitable overseas investments is far from settled, Democrats&apos pursuit of this line of argument offers some clues into what their investigations might focus on.\\nUniversity of North Carolina Law Professor Michael Gerhardt, a constitutional expert who testified during impeachment proceedings of former President Bill Clinton, told Fox News in an interview that Democrats might focus on Trump&aposs financial ties to Saudi Arabia.\\n\"It is possible \\xe2\\x80\\x94 would not be a surprise \\xe2\\x80\\x94 if there were some interest in exploring the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Saudi connections or finances,\" Gerhardt said, before adding: \"It would also not surprise me if the Democrats did not pursue these things.\"\\nTRUMP: SAUDI ARABIA DIDN&aposT KNOW HOW TO USE US-MADE BOMBS IN YEMEN\\nThe killing of dissident Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Turkey last month led to heightened scrutiny of the past connections between Trump&aposs business empire and the Islamic country. The president initially condemned what he characterized as a rush to judgment against the Saudi government, before saying that its agents had apparently engaged in the \"worst cover-up ever.\"\\nTrump has tweeted that he has \"no financial interests in Saudi Arabia,\" and there is no evidence that he currently does. However, he has repeatedly touted his real estate deals with the country, saying at a 2015 rally that \"they buy apartments from me\" and \"spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much.\"\\nIn August, Axios published a spreadsheet circulating among Republican circles on Capitol Hill documenting possible areas of focus for Democratic investigations. They include the White House&aposs revocation of top former officials&apos security clearances, Trump&aposs unreleased tax returns, and the administration&aposs proposed travel ban and a prohibition on transgender individuals in the military. Other topics on the list, which Axios said originated in the office of a senior Republican lawmaker, are Trump&aposs personal iPhone use and his personal payment to porn star Stormy Daniels -- a move that implicated, but did not appear to definitively violate campaign finance law.\\nFrequent Trump critic Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., said in an interview last week that Democrats intend to \"exercise oversight over the executive branch the way the Framers intended.\"\\nNAVY SEAL MOCKED BY &aposSNL&apos FOR EYE INJURY WINS HOUSE SEAT\\nHe went on to mirror Pelosi&aposs threat: \"We would be able to get Donald Trump&aposs tax returns to see if he&aposs being influenced by foreign entities. ... We can call in the secretary of Homeland Security [to] ask her why she still has hundreds of children she has not reunited that she ripped away from parents at the border. There are a lot of things that we can do with our oversight responsibility.\"\\nHouse Oversight and Government Reform Committee ranking member Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who is poised to become the committee&aposs chairman, offered another possible angle in an interview with The Hill. \"I want to look at what President Trump has done, aided and abetted by the Republicans in Congress, to tear down the foundations of our democracy,\" he said.\\nRepublicans who control the Oversight committee have rejected more than 50 Democratic requests for subpoenas of Trump administration documents, covering everything from the White House&aposs decision not to defend key provisions of ObamaCare in court, to perks used by Cabinet members.\\nA particularly prominent possible investigation would revolve around Trump&aposs decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, which critics have cited as potential obstruction of justice in part because Trump acknowledged that Russia-related matters were on his mind at the time.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe cover-up is always worse than the crime, and this one is very shady,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Andrew Hall, who represented a top adviser to then-President Richard Nixon during Watergate, said in an interview. Hall has maintained that Trump will \"undoubtedly be impeached.\"\\nHowever, legal experts, including emeritus Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz, have said that penalizing the president for firing an FBI director who serves at his pleasure would be unconstitutional, and others have pointed out that Comey&aposs firing would have done little to halt the Russia probe generally.\\nTRUMP QUOTES BEN STEIN, SAYS MIDTERMS WERE A &aposTREMENDOUS SUCCESS&apos AS GOP EXPANDS HOLD IN SENATE\\nMueller&aposs findings, which are expected to be submitted to Congress in a matter of months, might provide a launching point not only for further investigations but for even impeachment proceedings.\\n\"Impeachments tend to be driven by particular events that are instances of grave misconduct \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not liking someone or being an opponent is not likely to be enough to get the whole process started,\" Gerhardt told Fox News.\\nSuch an escalation, analysts warn, would potentially pose a risk to Democrats. \"I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think there is something as well developed as a tradition not to seek an impeachment when it appears conviction is unlikely or unthinkable,\" Gerhardt added. \"Nonetheless, I think there is always awareness of the possible risks of seeking an impeachment when conviction is impossible.\"\\nHandling many of these congressional inquiries will be the new White House Counsel, veteran high-powered Washington lawyer Pat Cipollone, who will oversee an office that dwindled from a staff of approximately 50 to fewer than 30 in recent weeks. That headcount is expected to expand significantly in the wake of Democrats&apos House takeover.\\n\"He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very talented and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very good man,\" Trump said last month, referring to Cipollone. In a campaign email in the days leading up to Tuesday&aposs vote, the president made an impassioned effort to cut down on Cipollone&aposs workload, saying Democrats are interested only in \"vicious obstruction and mindless resistance.\"\\n\"We can only imagine what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d do with legitimate power in our government,\" Trump said. \"We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hand Democrats the keys to Congress.

The pipeline would run from Canada to Nebraska where it would connect to existing lines running to U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast. The U.S. government needs to approve the pipeline because it would cross the nation&aposs northern border.\\nSeparately, late last year, the Army Corps of Engineers declined to allow construction of the Dakota Access pipeline under Lake Oahe, saying alternative routes needed to be considered. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its supporters say the project threatens drinking water and Native American sites, though Energy Transfer Partners, the company that wants to build the pipeline, disputes that and says the pipeline will be safe.\\nThe pipeline is to carry North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois.

He said the text was a response to events that included \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrump insulting the immigrant family of a fallen war hero, and my presumption based on that horrible, disgusting behavior that the American people would not elect someone demonstrating that behavior to be president of the United States.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Strzok was referring to Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attacks on Khizr Khan, who famously criticized Trump at the Democratic National Convention in 2016; his son, Captain Humayun Khan, was killed in Iraq in 2004.)\\nStrzok continued: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can assure you, Mr. Chairman, that at no time in any of these texts did those personal beliefs ever enter into the realm of any action I took. He added that the committee did not need to rely on his word, due the multiple layers agents involved in investigative decisions. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey would not tolerate any improper behavior in me any more than I would tolerate it in them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is who we are as the FBI.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nStrozk also told the panels that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d referred to in the text about \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstopping\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump was not the FBI, as Republicans have asserted, but American voters. His forceful remarks did not appease his critics, but they served to deflate the anti-Trump partisan narrative about him that his critics constructed over months while he remained silent. His statement in defense of himself and the FBI drew applause from some hearing attendees.\\nStrzok had used his opening statement at the hearing to make an obvious but overlooked point: If he wanted to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstop\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s election, he could have leaked information on the Trump campaign\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extensive contacts with Russia. But \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe thought of exposing that information never crossed my mind,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Strzok said. That made for an interesting contrast: As Democratic lawmakers noted, senior FBI officials in 2016 believed that agents in the FBI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s New York bureau were leaking information intended to damage Hillary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign. The Justice Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Inspector General concluded this year that concerns about leaks from that FBI field office influenced former FBI Director James Comey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possibly fateful decision to make public that the FBI had reopened its investigation of Hillary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emails just ahead of Election Day.\\nStrzok, citing advice from FBI lawyers, declined to detail his work on the Trump-Russia investigation. But he managed to highlight the significance of the Trump campaign\\xe2\\x80\\x99s alleged actions. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf there were people within the campaign who were colluding or working with the government of Russia, then there is very little that is more important for \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 the FBI [to] get to the bottom of,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. Strozk also expressed concern that Russia succeeded in influencing the outcome of the 2016 election by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cputting their finger on the scale\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of American public opinion.\\nDemocrats used the hearing to highlight Republican efforts to hinder the investigation into Trump. When Republicans threatened to hold Strzok in contempt of Congress for failing to answer some questions about the Russia probe, Democrats responded by forcing a joint committee vote aimed at subpoenaing former White House advisor Steve Bannon, who earlier this year refused to comply with a subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee. Republicans voted down that effort. Notably, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) appeared less than eager on this front: He said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpass\\xe2\\x80\\x9d during the roll call vote.\\nDemocrats also used the hearing to point out that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Robert Goodlatte and Gowdy previously justified their refusal to look into Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ties to Russia by asserting they wanted to avoid interfering with Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s investigation.\\nRep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, noted that Goodlatte said last year that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cuntil Mr. Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s investigation is complete, it is redundant for the House of Representatives to engage in fact-gathering on many of the same issues.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Goodlatte has also claimed that his committee \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwould never intrude on an active criminal investigation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nadler pointed out. But Nadler said that was belied by the fact that the Republicans, during an 11-hour private interview earlier in the week, asked Strzok more than 200 questions about the special counsel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s investigation, including about the FBI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use of confidential sources.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre we no longer going to wait until special counsel Mueller concludes his work, Mr. Chairman?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nadler asked, adding: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOr perhaps the rules of this joint investigation, such as they are, operate differently now that we are approaching the midterm elections and special counsel Mueller is closing in on the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s close associates.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d' target:-1\n",

On abortion, the platform states that Democrats \"strongly and unequivocally\" support Roe. v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision allowing abortion. Democrats write that abortion is right every woman should be afforded.\\n\"We oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right,\" the platform states. \"Abortion is an intensely personal decision between a woman, her family, her doctor, and her clergy; there is no place for politicians or government to get in the way.\"\\nAnd on same-sex marriage, the party writes it supports \"marriage equality\" and opposes \"discriminatory federal and state constitutional amendments\" that would prohibit gays and lesbians from marrying.\\nDemocrats also write they support repealing the Defense of Marriage Act, a law signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996 that defined marriage as a legal union between one man and one woman. Clinton is scheduled to speak at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte on Wednesday.\\nOther issues included in the official party document are a commitment to reducing the influence of monied special interests in politics, a pledge for comprehensive immigration reform that \"brings undocumented immigrants out of the shadows and requires them to get right with the law, learn English, and pay taxes in order to get on a path to earn citizenship,\" and a staunch defense of Obama\\'s health care law, which the platform says has improved the lives of millions of Americans.\\n\"No law is perfect and Democrats stand willing to work with anyone to improve the law where necessary, but we are committed to moving forward,\" the platform reads.' target:-1\n",

      "features:b'Democrat lieutenant governor and former San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom will face Republican businessman John Cox in November.\\nRepublican John Cox has secured a spot on the ballot to face Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom in the California gubernatorial election in November, boosted by a late endorsement from President Trump and voter discontent over liberal state policies.\\nFox News projects that Cox will advance to the general election in the race for governor, outpacing a former Democratic mayor for the No. 2 spot on the ballot. The state&aposs jungle primary system allows the top two finishers to advance regardless of party.\\nThe result is disappointing for Democratic former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who was widely considered the most viable potential challenger to Newsom in November&aposs general election in the extremely liberal state.\\nDemocrats&apos hopes of retaking Congress in November and mounting a national challenge to President Trump&aposs agenda hang in the balance, meanwhile, as ballots continue to be counted in several key House races in California and seven other states with primaries Tuesday.\\nTrump said in a May tweet that Cox will \"Make California Great Again,\" rallying the state&aposs conservative base around the businessman and saying he could solve California&aposs \"high crime, high tax problems.\"\\n\"This is only the first step to turning around this state and taking back California for all Californians,\" Cox told supporters in San Diego.\\nFox News also projects that Sen. Dianne Feinstein will place first in the state&aposs jungle primary -- a widely expected result. She will likely face ultra-progressive State Sen. Kevin de Leon in November, who delivered remarks early Wednesday strongly suggesting that he will be the runner-up.\\n\"This is only the first step to turning around this state and taking back California for all Californians.\"\\nThe state&aposs key House races, though, are still too close to call. The winners and losers in California&aposs most competitive races could take days to sort out given the state&aposs unique election laws.\\nThere were some results in from the House races early Wednesday. Republican Rep. Mimi Walters easily advanced to the November election in her Orange County district that has been targeted by Democrats. The second spot remained up for grabs.\\nAnd to the north, House intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes, a Republican, qualified for the general election ballot as well. Nunes is a polarizing figure in national politics given his support for Trump in one of the many investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\\nDemocrats need to flip 23 Republican-controlled to retake the House from the GOP in November. Out of California&aposs 53 House seats, Republicans hold 14 -- and seven of those GOP-held districts backed Hillary Clinton in 2016.\\nThat makes the Golden State center stage for what Democrats are hoping is a major anti-Trump wave in November.\\nIn several races, either Republicans or Democrats face the very real prospect of being denied a place on the ballot in the general election.\\nCALIF JUDGE IN SEX-ASSAULT CASE FACES RECALL VOTE\\nThat&aposs because of California&aposs nonpartisan, open \"jungle primary\" system, which advances the top two vote-getting candidates to the general election -- regardless of their party affiliation.\\nThe risk is particularly high for Democrats, who are riding a wave of anti-Trump enthusiasm in California. So many Democrats are running in three of the House races that they might split the vote to such an extent that two Republicans end up with the most ballots.\\nThat result would lock Democrats out of competing in the general election in some of the most vulnerable Republican districts, a kind of embarrassing political \"own goal\" that would highlight the quirks and perils of California&aposs unique primary procedure.\\nSeven other states held primaries on Tuesday, including New Jersey, Alabama, Mississippi, New Mexico, South Dakota, Iowa and Montana. Click here for results from those key races.\\nCalif. gubernatorial candidate Gavin Newsom is projected to finish in one of the top spots in the state\\'s jungle primary. (AP)\\nMore on California&aposs closest races:\\nThe governor&aposs race\\nNewsom, a liberal establishment Democrat who previously served as mayor of San Francisco, will win one of the two spots in the jungle primary and therefore will advance to the November ballot, Fox News can project.\\nRepublican businessman Cox will face him. But Newsom is the clear favorite in November&aposs statewide contest, given California&aposs overwhelmingly liberal electorate.\\nSome Democrats cried foul earlier this month after Newsom ran ads that reminded voters of Cox&aposs connections with Trump and the NRA, saying the frontrunner was implicitly trying to rally conservatives to the polls to ensure Cox beat Villaraigosa for the second spot on the ballot.\\nThe House races\\nOne of the most hotly contested races is in the 48th Congressional District, which includes Newport Beach and Laguna Beach. Hillary Clinton narrowly won the district in 2016. Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, who has held the safe seat without serious challenge for decades, faces eight Democrats and fierce competition from GOP rival Scott Baugh.\\nSo many Democrats are running for the seat that none may end up getting the votes needed to appear on the ballot in November.\\nWATCH: IS DANA ROHRABACHER BEING GROOMED AS A RUSSIAN AGENT? TUCKER TAKES ON LIBERAL HYSTERIA\\nA similar situation might play out in California&aposs 49th District, where a broad array of candidates is vying for the seat vacated by retiring GOP Rep. Darrell Issa. Eight Republican candidates are in the running, along with four Democrats who are neck-and-neck. The sheer number of entrants in the race could lock out either the GOP or the Democrats in November. Hillary Clinton also won here in 2016, by a margin of a little over seven points.\\nAnother closely watched race was the effort by four Democrats to unseat incumbent Republican Rep. Walters in the 45th District in Orange County, which no Democrat has ever represented but that also supported Clinton in 2016. Walters voted to repeal ObamaCare, which has become a hot-button issue in the increasingly liberal district. On Tuesday, Walters easily advanced to the November election. The second spot remains up for grabs.\\nImportant GOP-held seats with incumbents facing challenges are the 50th District, where Rep. Duncan Hunter is under investigation for misuse of campaign funds; the 10th District held by Rep. Jeff Denham; the 21st District, where Hillary Clinton won convincingly, that is currently occupied by David Valadao; and the 25th District, where Rep. Steve Knight is facing several challengers.\\nEd Royce, who was first elected to Congress in 1992 and chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, announced his retirement earlier this year. He will vacate his 39th District seat, and several Republican and Democratic candidates are competing to replace him. That setup, again, raises the possibility of one party being knocked entirely out of the November contest.\\nIncumbent Sen. Dianne Feinstein cruised to victory in Tuesday\\'s California primary, taking the top spot. (AP)\\nThe Senate race\\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., will place first in the jungle primary, Fox News projects, even though the California Democratic Party pointedly declined to endorse her in February.\\nThe majority of the votes from delegates at the party&aposs annual convention went to State Sen. Kevin de Leon, Feinstein&aposs progressive challenger who served as the former president pro tempore of the California Senate. Republican James P. Bradley, another hopeful in the primary, is not expected to make it to November&aposs contest.\\nAt 84 years old, Feinstein is the oldest senator in the U.S., and California&aposs increasingly liberal demographics raised concerns during the campaign that even Feinstein may be too moderate for the state&aposs new progressive wing. But her strong party backing, financial position and name recognition have offset those potential stumbling blocks.\\nIn remarks early Wednesday, Kevin de Leon didn&apost claim the second-place spot, but strongly suggested he&aposll be facing Feinstein in November.\\n\"A majority of Californians want new leadership in Washington,&apos he said. \"In November, voters will have the opportunity to send a message to Washington, and around the world that the system is broken, the status quo is failing, and the future is now.\"\\nFox News&apos Alex Pappas and The Associated Press contributed to this report.' target:1\n",
      "features:b\"In his address to an elite, invitation-only Washington foreign policy audience Wednesday, Donald Trump promised that, as president, he would restore a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccoherent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d vision to America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role in the world.\\nBut across the ideological spectrum, and even among natural allies, Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech received a failing grade for coherence and drew snickering and scorn from foreign policy insiders who remain unconvinced that Trump is up to the job.\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt struck me as a very odd mishmash,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Doug Bandow, a foreign policy scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, who shares many of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beliefs about scaling back America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role abroad. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe called for a new foreign policy strategy, but you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really get the sense he gave one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech was \\xe2\\x80\\x9clacking in policy prescriptions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and its \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstrident rhetoric masked a lack of depth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Robert \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBud\\xe2\\x80\\x9d McFarlane, a former national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan who attended the speech.\\nSpeaking at Washington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Mayflower Hotel, Trump mostly repeated familiar themes from his campaign, including promises to cut better trade deals with China, swiftly defeat the Islamic State, rebuild the military and reduce the expense America incurs in upholding international security from Europe to Asia.\\nTrump spoke from a teleprompter and in tones that were subdued by the standards of his raucous rallies. He also unveiled a new theme, saying that the U.S. would \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfinally have a coherent foreign policy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d based on narrow self-interest, economic gain and global stability.\\nBut Trump offered few specifics about his strategy, focusing on the alleged \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdisasters\\xe2\\x80\\x9d created by past presidents and a foreign policy establishment who \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfrankly don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing, even though they may look awfully good writing for The New York Times or talking on television.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nTrump said he would surround himself with \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctalented experts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnew people\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to help him chart a global strategy. But even though he said on MSNBC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMorning Joe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d earlier in the day that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be naming them today,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he did not do so.\\nThe audience was heavier on celebrity journalists like Bob Woodward and Jake Tapper than on the sort of prominent foreign policy thinkers and former government officials typically present at similar appearances by presidential candidates. Trump has largely been shunned by foreign-policy veterans of past Republican administrations, more than 100 members of whom recently signed an open letter saying they would not join his administration; some have threatened to vote for Hillary Clinton over Trump in November.\\nOne notable figure sitting in the front row as Trump repeated his call for better relations with Moscow \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believe an easing of tensions and improved relations with Russia, from a position of strength, is possible. Common sense says this cycle of hostility must end,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump said \\xe2\\x80\\x94 was Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ambassador to Washington, Sergey Kislyak. (Trump \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmade some intriguing points, but we need to understand what is meant in the implementation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Kislyak told POLITICO after the speech. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt needs to be started carefully.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)\\nAlso in attendance was a Trump foreign policy adviser Walid Phares, a Lebanese Maronite Christian who applauded vigorously when Trump said the U.S. had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cleft Christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe address was hosted by The National Interest magazine, an intellectual journal not often spotted on Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s private jet, but one that promotes the so-called realist school of foreign policy, which holds that the U.S. should pursue narrowly defined security interests with little concern for missions like promoting democracy or overthrowing repressive regimes.\\nSome of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech aligned with realist theory, including his disdain for U.S. interventions in the Arab world and what he called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interest in becoming a western democracy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nUnder a Trump presidency, he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of foreign countries.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut experts called Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech rife with internal tensions. He declared that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAmerica First\\xe2\\x80\\x9d would be the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmajor and overriding\\xe2\\x80\\x9d theme of his presidency moments before hailing America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role in World War II \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which was opposed by the isolationist America First movement of the early 1940s. He trashed President Barack Obama for failing to follow through with his threatened September 2013 air strikes in Syria, while also lamenting the chaos that has followed U.S. military interventions in Iraq and Libya. And Trump vowed to mend ties with U.S. allies who are fearful that America is withdrawing from the world, while insisting they pay more for their own security.\\nThe speech was \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccompletely contradictory, in the sense that the first message is that we should make allies pay not just for the cost of having troops in their countries but for the entire defense that the U.S. provides to Europe and Asia, which he estimated at trillions of dollars. And then in the next breath, he said that the U.S. can't be relied on and needs to be a better ally,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thomas Wright, a Brookings Institution fellow who has written extensively on Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s foreign policy.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just no way to reconcile these two statements. It certainly won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t reassure anyone internationally, or anyone within the Republican foreign policy establishment,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wright added.\\nBut Trump is also trying to broaden his electoral support, and some analysts said that the views of elites matter less than the populist sound bites about U.S. military and economic strength repeated on cable television Wednesday afternoon and evening.\\nTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s complaint that America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s NATO allies are not paying their fair share to support the European security alliance does echo at least one influential foreign policy thinker: Barack Obama, who in his address in Hanover, Germany, this week, scolded Europeans for being \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccomplacent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d about their own defense. Obama has also complained about \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfree riders\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from Europe to the Arab Middle East enjoying the benefits of U.S. protection without spending or risking more themselves.\\nObama has not however, explicitly threatened \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto let these countries defend themselves,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as Trump did Wednesday.\\nNot everyone was totally dismissive of the Manhattan mogul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appearance, including Zalmay Khalilzad, a former U.S. ambassador and a National Interest board member who introduced Trump on Wednesday.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe offered a coherent framework not totally outside the mainstream American foreign policy debate,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Khalilzad, who held several senior foreign policy posts in the George W. Bush administration, including ambassador to Iraq and to Afghanistan.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexpectations were low.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nTrump also left the hawkish Republican right deeply unimpressed. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a former 2016 presidential rival to Trump, issued a series of derisive tweets during the address, which he said was full of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdisconnected thought\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and demonstrated a \\xe2\\x80\\x9clack of understanding of threats we face.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRonald Reagan must be rolling over in his grave,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Graham tweeted.\\nMichael Hirsh contributed to this report.\" target:-1\n",

Kelly released a statement saying there is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno place for domestic violence in our society,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d though he clarified \\xe2\\x80\\x9cevery individual deserves the right to defend their reputation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hatch said Porter is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgood guy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enough there to take it very seriously.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIt also appears many in the White House, including Kelly and White House counsel Don McGahn, knew about the allegations against Porter long before they surfaced this week.\\n(Vox\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Andrew Prokop has a full explainer of the Porter allegations and the White House\\xe2\\x80\\x99s handling of it here.)\\nThat Trump would brush aside assault allegations is really not surprising\\nTrump has a long history of both employing and defending men accused of harming women, as Vox\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Anna North pointed out.\\nSteve Bannon, CEO of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presidential campaign and White House chief strategist until August 2017, was charged in 1996 with domestic violence, battery, and dissuading a witness. Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was charged with battery in March 2016 after a Breitbart reporter, Michelle Fields, reported he had forcibly grabbed her. (A prosecutor declined to proceed with the case.) Andrew Puzder, Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s initial nominee for secretary of labor, was accused of assault and battery by his ex-wife, Lisa Fierstein, and he eventually withdrew from consideration for the Cabinet post.\\nIn November, Trump backed Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for the US Senate seat in Alabama previously held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was accused of assaulting a 14-year-old girl and pursuing dates with other teenage girls when he was in his 30s. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe totally denies it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the president said of the allegations against Moore. Trump also came to the defense of ousted Fox News host Bill O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Reilly, who faced sexual harassment claims from multiple women and had a $32 million settlement with one accuser. Trump in April 2017 said O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Reilly is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgood person\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdid anything wrong.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAnd, of course, there are multiple allegations against Trump himself, which he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s denied. The president has been accused of sexual misconduct by at least 17 women, including his ex-wife Ivana, who reportedly said at a 1990 divorce deposition that he pulled out a fistful of her hair and raped her. (In 2015 she responded to a Daily Beast story, saying that the alleged rape was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwithout merit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) Trump was also caught on the now-infamous 2005 Access Hollywood tape bragging about sexual assault. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGrab \\xe2\\x80\\x98em by the pussy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said on the tape.\\nTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Saturday tweet was probably prompted by the Porter allegations and their immediate fallout. It also reflects his take on abuse and assault allegations against men by women: Some of them might be true, but a lot probably aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, and even if they are, who cares if it happened a long time ago, anyway?\\nAnd why wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he think that? For Trump, there haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been any consequences. He is the president of the United States, who on a Saturday in February has been tweeting a little extra because he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s watching television and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too rainy to go to the golf course.' target:-1\n",

      "features:b'WASHINGTON \\xe2\\x80\\x94 The trail that led American officials to blame North Korea for the destructive cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in November winds back to 2010, when the National Security Agency scrambled to break into the computer systems of a country considered one of the most impenetrable targets on earth.\\nSpurred by growing concern about North Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s maturing capabilities, the American spy agency drilled into the Chinese networks that connect North Korea to the outside world, picked through connections in Malaysia favored by North Korean hackers and penetrated directly into the North with the help of South Korea and other American allies, according to former United States and foreign officials, computer experts later briefed on the operations and a newly disclosed N.S.A. document.\\nA classified security agency program expanded into an ambitious effort, officials said, to place malware that could track the internal workings of many of the computers and networks used by the North\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hackers, a force that South Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s military recently said numbers roughly 6,000 people. Most are commanded by the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s main intelligence service, called the Reconnaissance General Bureau, and Bureau 121, its secretive hacking unit, with a large outpost in China.\\nThe evidence gathered by the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cearly warning radar\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of software painstakingly hidden to monitor North Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s activities proved critical in persuading President Obama to accuse the government of Kim Jong-un of ordering the Sony attack, according to the officials and experts, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about the classified N.S.A. operation.\\nMr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to accuse North Korea of ordering the largest destructive attack against an American target \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and to promise retaliation, which has begun in the form of new economic sanctions \\xe2\\x80\\x94 was highly unusual: The United States had never explicitly charged another government with mounting a cyberattack on American targets.\\nMr. Obama is cautious in drawing stark conclusions from intelligence, aides say. But in this case \\xe2\\x80\\x9che had no doubt,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d according to one senior American military official.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAttributing where attacks come from is incredibly difficult and slow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said James A. Lewis, a cyberwarfare expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe speed and certainty with which the United States made its determinations about North Korea told you that something was different here \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that they had some kind of inside view.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nFor about a decade, the United States has implanted \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbeacons,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which can map a computer network, along with surveillance software and occasionally even destructive malware in the computer systems of foreign adversaries. The government spends billions of dollars on the technology, which was crucial to the American and Israeli attacks on Iran\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nuclear program, and documents previously disclosed by Edward J. Snowden, the former security agency contractor, demonstrated how widely they have been deployed against China.\\nBut fearing the exposure of its methods in a country that remains a black hole for intelligence gathering, American officials have declined to talk publicly about the role the technology played in Washington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assessment that the North Korean government had ordered the attack on Sony.\\nThe extensive American penetration of the North Korean system also raises questions about why the United States was not able to alert Sony as the attacks took shape last fall, even though the North had warned, as early as June, that the release of the movie \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Interview,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a crude comedy about a C.I.A. plot to assassinate the North\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leader, would be \\xe2\\x80\\x9can act of war.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nDinner in Pyongyang\\nThe N.S.A.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s success in getting into North Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s systems in recent years should have allowed the agency to see the first \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspear phishing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d attacks on Sony \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the use of emails that put malicious code into a computer system if an unknowing user clicks on a link \\xe2\\x80\\x94 when the attacks began in early September, according to two American officials.\\nBut those attacks did not look unusual. Only in retrospect did investigators determine that the North had stolen the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccredentials\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of a Sony systems administrator, which allowed the hackers to roam freely inside Sony\\xe2\\x80\\x99s systems.\\nIn recent weeks, investigators have concluded that the hackers spent more than two months, from mid-September to mid-November, mapping Sony\\xe2\\x80\\x99s computer systems, identifying critical files and planning how to destroy computers and servers.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey were incredibly careful, and patient,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one person briefed on the investigation. But he added that even with their view into the North\\xe2\\x80\\x99s activities, American intelligence agencies \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really understand the severity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the destruction that was coming when the attacks began Nov. 24.\\nIn fact, when, Gen. James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, had an impromptu dinner in early November with his North Korean counterpart during a secret mission to Pyongyang to secure the release of two imprisoned Americans, he made no mention of Sony or the North\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growing hacking campaigns, officials say.\\nIn a recent speech at Fordham University in New York, Mr. Clapper acknowledged that the commander of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, Kim Yong-chol, with whom he traded barbs over the 12-course dinner, was \\xe2\\x80\\x9clater responsible for overseeing the attack against Sony.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (General Clapper praised the food; his hosts later presented him with a bill for his share of the meal.)\\nAsked about General Clapper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s knowledge of the Sony attacks from the North when he attended the dinner, Brian P. Hale, a spokesman for the director of national intelligence, said that the director did not know he would meet his intelligence counterpart and that the purpose of his trip to North Korea \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwas solely to secure the release of the two detained U.S. citizens.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause of the sensitivities surrounding the effort\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to win the Americans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 release, Mr. Hale said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe D.N.I. was focused on the task and did not want to derail any progress by discussing other matters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But he said General Clapper was acutely aware of the North\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growing capabilities.\\nJang Sae-yul, a former North Korean army programmer who defected in 2007, speaking in an interview in Seoul, said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey have built up formidable hacking skills. They have spent almost 30 years getting ready, learning how to do this and this alone, how to target specific countries.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nStill, the sophistication of the Sony hack was such that many experts say they are skeptical that North Korea was the culprit, or the lone culprit. They have suggested it was an insider, a disgruntled Sony ex-employee or an outside group cleverly mimicking North Korean hackers. Many remain unconvinced by the efforts of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, to answer critics by disclosing some of the American evidence.\\nMr. Comey told the same Fordham conference that the North Koreans got \\xe2\\x80\\x9csloppy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in hiding their tracks, and that hackers periodically \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconnected directly and we could see them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd we could see that the I.P. addresses that were being used to post and to send the emails were coming from I.P.s that were exclusively used by the North Koreans,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. Some of those addresses appear to be in China, experts say.\\nThe skeptics say, however, that it would not be that difficult for hackers who wanted to appear to be North Korean to fake their whereabouts. Mr. Comey said there was other evidence he could not discuss. So did Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the N.S.A. director, who told the Fordham conference that after reviewing the classified data he had \\xe2\\x80\\x9chigh confidence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the North had ordered the action.\\nA Growing Capability\\nNorth Korea built its first computer with vacuum tubes in 1965, with engineers trained in France. For a brief time, it appeared ahead of South Korea and of China, which not only caught up but also came to build major elements of their economic success on their hardware and software.\\nDefectors say that the Internet was first viewed by North Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leadership as a threat, something that could taint its citizens with outside ideas.\\nBut Kim Heung-kwang, a defector who said in an interview that he helped train many of the North\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first cyberspies, recalled that in the early 1990s a group of North Korean computer experts came back from China with a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery strange new idea\\xe2\\x80\\x9d: Use the Internet to steal secrets and attack the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enemies. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Chinese are already doing it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he quoted one of the experts as saying.\\nDefectors report that the North Korean military was interested. So was the ruling Workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Party, which in 1994 sent 15 North Koreans to a military academy in Beijing to learn about hacking. When they returned, they formed the core of the External Information Intelligence Office, which hacked into websites, penetrated fire walls and stole information abroad. Because the North had so few connections to the outside world, the hackers did much of their work in China and Japan.\\nAccording to Mr. Kim, the military began training computer \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwarriors\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in earnest in 1996 and two years later opened Bureau 121, now the primary cyberattack unit. Members were dispatched for two years of training in China and Russia. Mr. Jang said they were envied, in part because of their freedom to travel.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey used to come back with exotic foreign clothes and expensive electronics like rice cookers and cameras,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. His friends told him that Bureau 121 was divided into different groups, each targeting a specific country or region, especially the United States, South Korea and the North\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one ally, China.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey spend those two years not attacking, but just learning about their target country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Internet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jang, 46, who was a first lieutenant in a different army unit that wrote software for war game simulations.\\nMr. Jang said that as time went on, the North began diverting high school students with the best math skills into a handful of top universities, including a military school specializing in computer-based warfare called Mirim University, which he attended as a young army officer.\\nOthers were deployed to an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cattack base\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang, where there are many North Korean-run hotels and restaurants. Unlike the North\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, the cyberforces can be used to harass South Korea and the United States without risking a devastating response.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCyberwarfare is simply the modern chapter in North Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long history of asymmetrical warfare,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said a security research report in August by Hewlett-Packard.\\nAn Attack in Seoul\\nWhen the Americans first gained access to the North Korean networks and computers in 2010, their surveillance focused on the North\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nuclear program and its leadership, as well as efforts to detect attacks aimed at United States military forces in South Korea, said one former American official. (The German magazine Der Spiegel published an N.S.A. document on Saturday that provides some details of South Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s help in spying on the North.) Then a highly destructive attack in 2013 on South Korean banks and media companies suggested that North Korea was becoming a greater threat, and the focus shifted.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe big target was the hackers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the official said.\\nThat attack knocked out almost 50,000 computers and servers in South Korea for several days at five banks and television broadcasters.\\nThe hackers were patient, spending nine months probing the South Korean systems. But they also made the mistake seen in the Sony hack, at one point revealing what South Korean analysts believe to have been their true I.P. addresses. Lim Jong-in, dean of the Graduate School of Information Security at Korea University, said those addresses were traced back to Shenyang, and fell within a spectrum of I.P. addresses linked to North Korean companies.\\nThe attack was studied by American intelligence agencies. But after the North issued its warnings about Sony\\xe2\\x80\\x99s movie last June, American officials appear to have made no reference to the risk in their discussions with Sony executives. Even when the spear-phishing attacks began in September \\xe2\\x80\\x94 against Sony and other targets \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t set off alarm bells,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d according to one person involved in the investigation.\\nThe result is that American officials began to focus on North Korea only after the destructive attacks began in November, when pictures of skulls and gruesome images of Sony executives appeared on the screens of company employees. (That propaganda move by the hackers may have worked to Sony\\xe2\\x80\\x99s benefit: Some employees unplugged their computers immediately, saving some data from destruction.)\\nIt did not take long for American officials to conclude that the source of the attack was North Korea, officials say. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFiguring out how to respond was a lot harder,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one White House official said.' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'(CNN)The White House on Monday said that CNN correspondent Jim Acosta\\'s press pass has been \"restored,\" bowing to days of pressure and a federal lawsuit against the administration.\\nIn response, CNN said in a court filing that it has dropped the ongoing litigation over Acosta\\'s access to the White House.\\n\"Today the White House fully restored Jim Acosta\\'s press pass. As a result, our lawsuit is no longer necessary,\" the network said in a statement. \"We look forward to continuing to cover the White House.\"\\nMonday afternoon\\'s announcement, what the White House called a \"final determination,\" was an abrupt shift from the administration\\'s earlier positions.\\nNearly two weeks ago the Trump administration took the unprecedented step of suspending Acosta\\'s access to the White House after he had a contentious exchange with President Trump at a press conference.\\nWhen a federal judge sided with CNN and issued a temporary restraining order last Friday, thereby forcing the White House to restore his press pass for 14 days, the administration continued to threaten his access.\\nIn a private letter to Acosta that same evening, two of the defendants in CNN\\'s suit -- press secretary Sarah Sanders and deputy chief of staff for communications Bill Shine -- cited Acosta\\'s conduct at the November 7 press conference, where he asked multiple follow-up questions and didn\\'t give up the microphone right away. \"You failed to abide\" by \"basic, widely understood practices,\" the letter to Acosta claimed.\\nMany journalists have challenged the administration\\'s actions, pointing out that aggressive questioning is a tradition that dates back decades. But Trump appeared eager to advance an argument about White House press corps \"decorum,\" no matter how hypocritical.\\nThe letter from Shine and Sanders said their \"preliminary decision\" after the press conference was to suspend the press pass. This indicated that the White House could take further action against Acosta as soon as the judge\\'s temporary restraining order expired.\\nIt was also a sign that the White House was trying to establish a paper trail. The judge in the case, Timothy J. Kelly, had criticized the government for not following due process before banning Acosta on November 7. His ruling in Acosta and CNN\\'s favor was on Fifth Amendment due process grounds.\\nSo Friday night\\'s letter offered Acosta a chance to contest the decision and said a \"final determination\" would be made by Monday at 3 p.m.\\nLawyers for Acosta and CNN did respond, forcefully, in a letter and in a court filing.\\nThey had signaled a willingness to settle after prevailing in court on Friday. But in a new motion on Monday morning, they said the defendants \"did not respond to this offer to cooperate.\" Instead, the letter from Shine and Sanders was an \"attempt to provide retroactive due process,\" the filing alleged.\\nSo CNN and Acosta asked the judge to set a schedule of deadlines for motions and hearings that would give the network the chance to win a preliminary injunction, a longer form of court-ordered protection to Acosta\\'s press pass.\\nThey were seeking a hearing \"for the week of November 26, 2018, or as soon thereafter as possible,\" according to the court filing.\\nThe judge had yet to file on that request when the Monday at 3 p.m. deadline came.\\nThe new Monday afternoon letter from Sanders and Shine included no expiration date, though it did contain the general threat to take action against reporters who flouts new \"rules.\"\\nThe White House\\'s letter said, \"Having received a formal reply from your counsel to our letter of November 16, we have made a final determination in this process: your hard pass is restored. Should you refuse to follow these rules in the future, we will take action in accordance with the rules set forth above. The President is aware of this decision and concurs.\"\\nThe White House press corps, however, has not agreed to any new set of rules governing presidential press conferences. And Trump rarely holds press conferences anyway.\\nThe White House Correspondents\\' Association said Monday it had \"no role in crafting\" what the White House sent out.\\nThe letter asserts that reporters may ask \"a single question\" at a press conference. Follow-ups will only be permitted \"at the discretion of the President or other White House officials.\" And reporters must \"physically surrender\" the microphone, when directed.\\nIn practice, many reporters asked follow-up questions at the November 7 press conference.\\nAnd that\\'s not going to change any time soon. \"For as long as there have been White House press conferences, White House reporters have asked follow-up questions.

If we do not, our party&aposs appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only,\" it said. The study also called for being more \"inclusive and welcoming\" when it comes to social issues.\\nThe report, though, also described two different tracks for the GOP. On one, state-level candidates are winning elections and re-defining the party. On the other, the \"federal wing\" of Republicans is \"increasingly marginalizing itself.\"\\nThe report said \"it is time for Republicans on the federal level to learn from successful Republicans on the state level.\"\\nThe report calls on Republicans to take a harder line with corporate America, loosen political fundraising laws in Washington and in state capitals, and cut in half the number of candidate debates in a shortened 2016 presidential primary calendar.\\n\"When Republicans lost in November, it was a wakeup call,\" RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said.\\nThe Republican National Committee&aposs shift on minority outreach may be the most visible change in the coming months.\\nPriebus plans to dispatch hundreds of paid workers into Hispanic, black and Asian communities across the nation by the end of the summer, a $10 million effort meant to rival President Obama&aposs national political machine.\\nThe RNC also will push for a tone of \"tolerance and respect\" in the immigration debate, create \"senior level advisory councils\" focused on minority groups, and establish \"swearing-in citizenship teams\" to connect with new voters immediately after swearing-in ceremonies.\\n\"We need to go to communities where Republicans do not normally go to listen and make our case,\" the report says. \"We need to campaign among Hispanic, black, Asian and gay Americans and demonstrate that we care about them, too.\"\\nThe recommendations will not be well received in all corners of the Republican Party.\\nSome Republicans, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio among them, are working toward bipartisan immigration reform that is likely to include a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants -- sometimes called \"amnesty.\" Conservative commentator Ann Coulter ripped the idea in a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference over the weekend.\\n\"If amnesty goes through, America becomes California and no Republican will ever win another national election,\" Coulter said.\\nThe RNC&aposs recommendations follow an extensive look at what went wrong in 2012.\\nPriebus tapped a handful of respected party leaders to examine how the GOP could better talk with voters, raise money from donors and learn from Democrats&apos tactics. The report also suggests that party officials could lean more on independent groups such as super political action committees to fund television advertising campaigns, allowing the Republican National Committee to focus on strategy and contacting voters.\\nAri Fleischer, White House press secretary under former President George W. Bush, and Bradshaw, a top adviser to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, were among those leading the inquiry. Republican National Committeeman Henry Barbour, a GOP strategist and nephew of former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, was also part of the group.

      "features:b'The deal is meant to mollify millions of people enraged after their insurers canceled policies that do not meet Obamacare requirements. But how many it will ultimately help remains to be seen.\\nThe uproar over the cancellations has ensnared the White House for weeks, shining a spotlight on Obama\\'s previous promise that people who liked their insurance plans can keep them.\\n\"This fix won\\'t solve every problem for every person. But it\\'s going to help a lot of people,\" the president said at the White House.\\nBut the fix, as reported earlier by CNN\\'s Dana Bash, puts the onus of the renewals outside the president\\'s control: The administration is not requiring insurers or state insurance commissioners to extend the existing plans, but instead is letting them offer an additional year of coverage.\\nAlso, insurers must notify policyholders of the difference in benefits between their policies and the Obamacare plans available on the insurance exchanges. And the companies must inform people that additional policies are available on the exchanges and that subsidies may be available to those who qualify.\\nShare your story: Are you signing up for Obamacare?\\nNot everyone who has received a cancellation notice, however, may be able to extend.\\nSince insurance is regulated at the state level, it remains up to the commissioners to permit the extensions and the companies to do so. The president noted that not all commissioners may agree to extensions. At least four states -- California, Idaho, Virginia and Kentucky -- are requiring all individual plans adhere to Obamacare rules.\\nThe insurance industry said the reversal could cause major problems, including a hike in premiums if fewer younger and healthier people opt to buy in the exchanges.\\n\"Changing the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers,\" said Karen Ignagni, chief executive of America\\'s Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group. \" Additional steps must be taken to stabilize the marketplace and mitigate the adverse impact on consumers.\"\\nRelated: Healthcare.gov needs more than tech fixes\\nIn his remarks, Obama said he didn\\'t want his signature policy to be the reason people are losing their insurance.\\n\"The key point is that it allows us to be able to say to the folks who receive these notices, look, you know, I, the president of the United States, and the insurance -- the insurance model of the Affordable Care Act -- is not going to be getting in the way of you shopping in the individual market that you used to have,\" he said.\\nBut he also stressed that the reason for health reform is that the current system did not work well, and that Americans will be able to find better quality insurance on the exchanges.\\n\"It\\'s important that we don\\'t pretend that somehow that\\'s a place worth going back to,\" he said, of the existing individual market. \"Too often, it works fine, as long as you stay healthy. It doesn\\'t work well when you\\'re sick.\"\\nSee how many people signed up in your state\\nAlso, in announcing the changes Thursday, Obama apologized for the rough start to enrollment in the federal and state exchanges. The websites have been marred by major technological problems that have stymied many visitors from registering accounts, determining whether they are eligible for subsidies and picking insurance plans.

      "features:b\"Confrontation between Israel and Hamas is an old movie. But the grim version playing out now -- with Hamas rockets, particularly use of a long range Fajr 5, aimed at Tel Aviv , Israeli airstrikes and the killing of a top Hamas official -- contains new and disturbing scenes. That said, there is reason to hope this won't turn into a complete disaster film. And Egypt may well be the key.\\nThe last time Israel and Hamas tangled, in 2008 and 2009, the result was mayhem that left as many as 1,400 Palestinians dead, saw Israelis terrified and living in shelters, and destroyed large areas of Gaza. With diametrically opposed strategies and political goals, Hamas and Israel are fights waiting to happen.\\nBut the current conflict contains several new and dangerous aspects likely to be with us for some time to come.\\nJihadi elements\\nPart of the reason we've witnessed an uptick in the number of rocket attacks \\\\-- 750 this year -- is that a variety of smaller groups that Hamas cannot control, or chooses not to control, have been operating with greater impunity. Some are former Hamas militants, others are newbies, and they are testing the limits of Israel's reactions with the rocket attacks. One of those groups, Jaysh al-Islam, may have played a role in the August 8 attack that left 16 Egyptian soldiers dead in Sinai.\\nHamas under pressure\\nIn the face of this new competition, Hamas just can't fold up its tent and surrender the field. That means the Gaza-based organization needs to compete with or control these groups. And it's tough for Hamas to function as Israel's police officer, struggling to contain the smaller jihadi groups. After all, part of Hamas' reason for being is its championing of the armed struggle, a cause it can't abandon.\\nNow, with Hamas' external base of operation undermined in Syria as a result of the popular uprising there, Gaza becomes the main seat and repository of its legitimacy. And it must always demonstrate that it's the key actor there. Unlike Fatah and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, it doesn't want to launch a U.N. initiative for statehood or even toy with the notion of negotiating with Israel. Maintaining the military option remains paramount.\\nIsrael's politics and strategy\\nThe Israelis are determined, particularly as they face the uncertainties of the Arab spring/winter, to demonstrate that they can protect their interests, particularly if challenged.\\nNew actions by the jihadi groups and longtime concerns over Hamas' high-trajectory weapons have made Israel more likely to launch preventive attacks. The killing of Hamas military wing leader Ahmed al-Ja'abari, whom the Israelis have apparently targeted at least once before, was the manifestation of this proactive posture.\\nNews: Rockets pound Israel, Gaza as Netanyahu alleges 'double war crime'\\nWhen you combine that with pressure on the Israeli government from communities exposed to rocket attacks, not to mention the upcoming elections in January, you have the makings of a very determined response. Particularly against the backdrop of an Iranian nuclear threat he can't defuse, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a stake in demonstrating that Israel can deter the Gazan threat and deal with it successfully.\\nBut as bad as the situation appears, logic and self-interest should suggest de-escalation. Neither Israel nor Hamas has a stake in repeating the events of 2008 and 2009. War didn't fix the problem then, and it's unlikely to fix it now. Nor do the Israelis -- when the real threat is Iran -- want to get into a major military and political mess over Gaza that would make their relationship with Egypt even more complicated.\\nThe government of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy has taken steps to support the Palestinians: tough rhetoric, recalling its ambassador from Israel, summoning the Arab League and putting the issue into play at the U.N. and sending its Prime Minister to Gaza. But it has no stake in seeing this conflict escalate or in attaching its future to Hamas or the jihadis, which it fears both in Gaza and in Sinai.\\nEgypt also has other priorities, such as economic aid. And at a time when the International Monetary Fund is negotiating a loan of over $4 billion and when it could use American support, Egypt doesn't want to get too close to Hamas. The longer the conflict goes on, and the greater the civilian casualties, the harder it will be for Morsy to play a positive role.\\nCooler heads ought to prevail. Egypt should press Hamas to control the jihadis and to reimpose a truce--perhaps in exchange for a more open border with Gaza and greater political support from Turkey and Qatar, and the U.S. should urge restraint on Israel to allow Hamas to stand down.

She endorsed Obama \"immediately\" after dropping out in June, she said.\\n\"I was pleased when Sen. Sanders said the other day he\\'s going to work tirelessly, seven days a week, to make sure that Donald Trump is not president and I really welcome that,\" Clinton said. \"We had run a really tough race (in 2008) all the way to the end but I endorsed him, I began working for him, and of course we talked about the platform.\"\\nShe also suggested Sanders supporters who say they cannot support Clinton will come around.\\n\"I think when I dropped, I think the polling was that 40% of my supporters said they would not support Sen. Obama. Thankfully, the vast majority of them did, so this is a natural kind of process that I think will play itself out,\" Clinton said.\\nBut she said, speaking from experience, Sanders will see the writing on the wall.\\n\"There comes a time when you have to look at the reality,\" Clinton said. \"In fact, in \\'08 I was much closer in both popular vote and pledged delegates to Sen. Obama than is the case right now, but eventually I just decided that I had to withdraw and support Sen. Obama because the goal was to make sure we had a Democrat in the White House.\"\\nHarsh words for Trump\\nThough Clinton wouldn\\'t respond directly to Trump\\'s attacks on her, personally, she did go after him on a number of fronts.\\nShe criticized his foreign policy as \"reckless, loose, dangerous\" and said he is \"really insulting to women,\" casting doubt that Sanders supporters would migrate to him over her when he also doesn\\'t believe in climate change or raising the minimum wage.\\nClinton also derided Trump for what she characterized as a \"secret plan\" to defeat ISIS and said she found his comments lately \"disturbing.\"\\n\"I don\\'t think loose talk about loose nukes, I don\\'t think turning our back on our strongest allies, I don\\'t think pretending you have some sort of secret plan is a very smart way to go forward in leading the world, which is what we must do,\" Clinton said.\\nShe also laughed when Tapper asked if at Trump\\'s wedding to Melania in 2005 Clinton ever imagined she\\'d be running against him in a presidential election, adding she didn\\'t think she\\'d be running.\\n\"Never crossed my mind, no.

      "features:b'President Donald Trump just said he wants America to have a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspace force\\xe2\\x80\\x9d charged with protecting America in, well, space. The problem is that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unclear he will actually get one.\\nOn Monday, Trump signed an executive order meant to create the space force, which would be the sixth branch of the US military (but the White House text of the order doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feature a directive to create the space force). He then asked Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to oversee the creation of the new service. If it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s officially created, the Air Force would likely give up all of its space duties to the space force, including preparing for war in space and protecting US satellites from harm.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have the Air Force, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have the space force,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump said during a speech from the White House. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSeparate but equal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nTrump has long called for the creation of a space force, saying in March that it would be \\xe2\\x80\\x9clike the Army and the Navy, but for space, because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re spending a lot of money on space.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d There was even a congressional push last year that tried to formally create the new service.\\nBut Congress flatly rejected that proposal. In this fiscal year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s must-pass defense budget bill, both the House and the Senate decided against a new space force, preferring instead to keep space defense within the Air Force.\\nThat doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to matter to Trump, since he has now ordered the creation of the space-focused service. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unclear whether Trump can actually create a military branch out of thin air. But one thing is for sure: He doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have much support for it.\\nA senior congressional source told me that Congress \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not the president \\xe2\\x80\\x94 would need to authorize a new military service, just like it did in 1947 when it created the Air Force. After all, the Constitution is clear that the Congress has the authority \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto raise and support armies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s another problem: The Air Force is adamantly against a space force. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Pentagon is complicated enough,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson told reporters last summer. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis will make it more complex, add more boxes to the organization chart.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nEven Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis came out against it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI oppose the creation of a new military service and additional organizational layers at a time when we are focused on reducing overhead and integrating joint warfighting efforts,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mattis wrote in a letter to congressional defense leaders last October.\\nOf course, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing stopping Trump from wanting a space force or even ordering its establishment. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just an open question as to whether there will ever be a space force.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c[T]he near-term practical effect of all this is that the president can direct DoD to come up with a plan and start preparing to create a space force, but he still needs congress to authorize it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Todd Harrison, a defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, tweeted on Monday.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSpace is no longer a peaceful domain\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good case to make for a space force, though.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSpace is no longer a peaceful domain,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Deborah Lee James, the Obama administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s final Air Force secretary, said in an interview last July. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is a real possibility that a conflict on Earth could bleed into space.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThere are two main reasons for that: Russia and China. According to the Defense Intelligence Agency, Russia wants to gain more power in space because it believes gaining supremacy there will allow it to win future fights on this planet. And in late 2015, China created the Strategic Support Force, which is meant to streamline and improve its space, cyber, and electronic warfare missions.\\nThe two countries are causing problems with anti-satellite technology, too, noted Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing last May \\xe2\\x80\\x94 meaning they could mess with the satellites that help the US military do its job. The Pentagon is planning to open a space-war center to counter their threats.\\nOkay, but ... what sort of conflict is actually going on in space? What are we really talking about?\\nBasically, there are tons of military equipment in space, especially satellites. This kind of equipment helps the US, Russia, and China \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and any tech-savvy force \\xe2\\x80\\x94 navigate terrain and communicate with one another. On top of that, assets in space help to track enemy fighters, take pictures for intelligence services, and even help control missiles. Without space, it would be much harder to fight on Earth; that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why Russia and China are investing so heavily in it.\\nBut Russia and China aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t space\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only threats. The area just outside Earth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s orbit has seen an explosion of commercial satellites and other communications equipment since the 1960s, put there first by countries and, as of late, by commercial companies. That equipment is used to help drivers reach their destination, help potential lovers swipe right on dating apps, or simply help people text friends.\\nThe chart below shows the huge growth in these satellites. The blue line represents their total growth since around 1960.\\nThe internet, of course, adds a new complication to all the equipment that countries are putting in space. Most notably, equipment can potentially be hacked. For instance, a team of hackers could jam a satellite by messing with its signals so it interrupts the satellite\\xe2\\x80\\x99s normal activity, rendering it useless. That could cause problems for all sorts of everyday activities, like credit card transactions and phone calls.\\nThen, of course, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s space debris threatening all of that commercial and military space equipment, since it could knock into the expensive machines. NASA estimates that there are 20,000 pieces of debris larger than a softball orbiting the Earth, about 500,000 pieces of debris the size of a marble or larger, and many millions of pieces that are too small to register.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is a solution in search of a problem\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe idea is that creating a new service will ensure that there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a segment of the military whose entire job is to focus on space 100 percent of the time. That would allow a space force to counter Russia, China, and other threats while giving space-focused staff more bureaucratic power inside the Pentagon.\\nBut Sean O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Keefe, a former NASA head and Navy secretary, thinks creating a brand new branch of the military is not the right way to go. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is a solution in search of a problem,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told me in an interview last summer. Basically, he thinks the Air Force is already doing a fine job protecting space, even if it does privilege earthbound pilots. Creating a space force would just add another layer of bureaucracy to an already massive organization: the Pentagon.\\nJames, the former Air Force secretary, agrees. She thinks dealing with the current complaints about the Air Force and space \\xe2\\x80\\x94 1) that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not well-funded, 2) that acquisition takes too long, and 3) that there is no one person to call about military space operations \\xe2\\x80\\x94 makes more sense.\\nSo clearly the space force has its detractors, not least Defense Secretary Mattis. And of course, Congress has yet to officially mandate its creation.\\nBut with Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s comments on Monday, the space force conversation has kicked into hyperdrive. Time will tell if future US troops will be wearing space helmets.' target:-1\n",

      "features:b'WASHINGTON \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Hours after a bipartisan group of eight senators introduced a sweeping overhaul of the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s immigration system, conservative radio talk show hosts took over two floors of a Capitol Hill hotel on Wednesday and denounced the proposal on the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s drive-time airwaves as nothing more than a reward for lawbreakers.\\nOn a Florida station, WFTL, the host Joyce Kaufman called it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpure amnesty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jim Sharpe, a talk show host on KFYI in Phoenix, promised that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cArizonans are still not taking this sitting down.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d On Denny Schaffer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s show in New Orleans, callers demanded deportations.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see nothing wrong with putting them on a bus and shipping them back to wherever they came from,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a caller named Alan told Mr. Schaffer. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe law\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the law.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut even some of the talk show hosts most vehemently opposed to illegal immigration said they were worried that times have changed. They said their listeners seemed less agitated by the prospect that 11 million illegal immigrants might be granted legal status and concede that proponents of the legislation \\xe2\\x80\\x94 who now include some conservative radio personalities \\xe2\\x80\\x94 are better at promoting their message this time around.\\nThe senators filed their 844-page bill after 2 a.m. Wednesday, officially beginning what President Obama and other supporters hope will be a six-week effort to pass it in the Senate by early June. Hearings on the legislation, which tightens border security and offers an eventual path to citizenship, are set to begin on Friday.\\nOpponents of the measure are eager to harness the conservative airwaves the way they did in 2007, when talk radio hosts helped whip up a fury of outrage that doomed similar legislation supported by President George W. Bush. This time there were 46 talk radio hosts sharing booths in the Phoenix Park Hotel, where they bent over their microphones and broadcast to places like Albany, Salt Lake City and Huntsville, Ala.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo far this has been an inside-the-Beltway echo chamber,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bob Dane, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which organized the gathering. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat they have not had yet is a good, cold blast of air in the face from the rank-and-file conservative. We now have a bill. This is the game-changer where the American public is now starting to weigh in.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut how the public weighs in \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and what they say when they call in to the shows \\xe2\\x80\\x94 remains an open question.\\nSean Hannity, who in 2007 used his nationally syndicated radio program and perch at Fox News to rail against an immigration overhaul, now says that he has \\xe2\\x80\\x9cevolved\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that it is time for Republicans to support some kind of major change in the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s immigration system. Opposition from some Republican lawmakers has softened since the 2012 presidential election, when Mr. Obama won the vast majority of Hispanic votes. Evangelical Christians, many of whom were opposed to an overhaul in 2007, are now among the biggest supporters.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are some people who lost their will to fight this fight,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ms. Kaufman, who remains combative but admitted in an interview during a commercial break that she was worried the legislation might pass. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey think they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve lost it already and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve sort of thrown in the towel, including my fellow radio hosts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nOr as Mr. Schaffer from New Orleans put it, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is not that rage that was there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nFrom the beginning of this year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s immigration talks, senators from both parties braced for the reaction on conservative talk radio once the legislation was made public. Their memories were still fresh from six years ago, when activists at town hall meetings who had listened to talk radio harshly criticized Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, for his support of the 2007 proposed legislation.\\nThis time proponents are hoping that Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and a member of the group of eight, will be able to mute the impact of the conservative chatter. Mr. Rubio, a Tea Party favorite, has spent much of his time in recent months talking about the proposals on conservative radio programs.\\nThat appears to have worked, at least a little. Michael Medved, one of the few conservative talk show hosts who has always supported an immigration overhaul, said he sensed a shift.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat you are not hearing as much, except from a handful of people, is \\xe2\\x80\\x98over my dead body,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Medved said in an interview. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe level of apocalyptic hysteria is much less.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThere are nonetheless plenty of talk show hosts who disagree with Mr. Hannity and Mr. Medved, as was clear at the Phoenix Park Hotel, where the hosts and activists sported \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBorder Security Now!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d buttons. Many hosts and callers derided the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgang of eight\\xe2\\x80\\x9d senators who drafted the legislation as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceight gangsters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut a few blocks away on the East Front of the Capitol, more than 300 evangelical Christian pastors gathered for what they billed as a national day of prayer to support the immigration legislation. Unlike 2007, this year evangelicals have mobilized some Christian radio hosts on behalf of immigration and are running saturation ad campaigns summoning evangelicals to obey biblical instructions that call for welcoming the stranger.\\nIn South Carolina, evangelical leaders ran radio commercials defending Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican who is an author of the bipartisan bill, and Representative Trey Gowdy, also a Republican. The lawmakers were \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinundated \\xe2\\x80\\x94 very happily inundated\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with calls from evangelicals, said Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention\\xe2\\x80\\x99s policy arm.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve provided an example that when people like Lindsey Graham and Trey Gowdy get targeted, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got their back,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Land said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand we can activate a counternetwork.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d' target:-1\n",

Thirteen counties in Southern California \\xe2\\x80\\x94 all Republican, save two \\xe2\\x80\\x94 would be jettisoned, forming a state of about 13 million that would rival Pennsylvania or Illinois.

      "features:b'Donald Trump has used the first Oval Office address of his presidency to stoke fears of illegal immigration, repeat dubious claims about his border wall, and offer no new solutions to the partial government shutdown.\\nIn the type of made-for-TV-moment he relishes, Trump blamed criminal gangs and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvast quantities of illegal drugs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthousands of deaths\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and faulted Democrats for failing to end the shutdown, now in its 19th day.\\nTop congressional Democrats accused him of fearmongering, and using rhetoric \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfull of misinformation and even malice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is a humanitarian crisis \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump told primetime viewers on Tuesday night, describing the situation at the border. He argued that the current immigration system allows \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvicious coyotes and ruthless gangs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to prey on immigrants, especially women and children.\\nThe Oval Office has typically been a projection of power used by presidents before him to address the nation at times of crisis or tragedy. In remarks lasting 10 minutes, Trump sought to make the case for a border wall \\xe2\\x80\\x93 arguably the central promise of his short political career \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and tried to imply the proposal had broad public support.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLaw enforcement professionals have requested $5.7bn for a physical barrier,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also what our professionals at the border want and need.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is just common sense. The border wall would very quickly pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500bn a year, vastly more than the $5.7bn we have requested from Congress. The wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nFactcheckers have poured scorn on Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assertion that the trade deal, a successor to Nafta, means that Mexico is paying for the wall. The Mexican government has always refused to do so. And following the address, critics were quick to point out that Democrats are against money for a border wall \\xe2\\x80\\x93 whether steel or concrete.\\nNearly three weeks in to the shutdown, Trump did not offer fresh ideas to break the current political impasse and did not declare a national emergency so that he could bypass Congress, as had been speculated. Instead he said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nCalling on Democrats to pass a spending bill, he added: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting. Hopefully we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nOn an extraordinary night for US politics, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, delivered a live rebuttal from the House speaker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s balcony hallway. Both adamantly oppose the construction of a wall and have urged Trump to reopen the government while talks continue.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSadly, much of what we have heard from President Trump throughout this senseless shutdown has been full of misinformation and even malice,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pelosi said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPresident Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis, and must reopen the government.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSchumer added: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t govern by temper-tantrum. No president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down, hurting millions of Americans who are treated as leverage.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTonight \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and throughout this debate and his presidency \\xe2\\x80\\x93 President Trump has appealed to fear, not facts. Division, not unity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe New York senator said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMost presidents have used Oval Office addresses for noble purposes. This president just used the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe White House countered those points on Wednesday by accusing Democrats of being in denial.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fighting for the protection and the safety of every American citizen,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf this is the face and the future of the Democrat party I think things are looking really good for Republicans.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nTrump has privately dismissed the address to the nation and his proposed visit to the border this week as pointless, according to the New York Times. In an off-the-record lunch with television anchors on Tuesday, he reportedly said he was talked into both steps by advisers.\\nIn the run-up to the address, the White House had been caught in a series of falsehoods. At the weekend, Sanders claimed 4,000 known or suspected terrorists had been apprehended at the southern border. On Monday, Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, admitted that this was \\xe2\\x80\\x9can unfortunate misstatement\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as most of the individuals had been stopped at airports.\\nMeanwhile, Pence was questioned by NBC News on Monday about Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim that some former presidents told him a wall should be built (all four living presidents have denied it). The vice-president replied: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know the president has said that that was his impression from previous administrations, previous presidents.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe president, who has threatened to keep the government closed for months or even years, will attend a Senate Republican lunch meeting on Wednesday, then visit the southern border on Thursday as he continues to wage a public relations offensive. The partial government shutdown is now the second-longest in history, affects more than 800,000 workers, and there is no end in sight.\\nOn Tuesday night, immigrants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 right groups again condemned Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s message. Lorella Praeli, the deputy political director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith tonight\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech, President Trump chose to compound the chaos because he can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t convince the majority of Americans that their taxpayer dollars should fund his bogus campaign promise ...

Well into the final quarter of Obama\\'s presidency the White House approach is, if you can\\'t join \\'em, beat \\'em.\\nEven with a whiff of bipartisanship in the air, the president is going on offense and building on a strategy employed since Democrats lost control of the Senate. Disagree with a Republican? The White House approach is to single a lawmaker out, pick a fight and don\\'t mince words.\\nIn just the past week, the president and his spokesman have targeted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Republican Sens.

Enough!\" he said, addressing Senate Republicans. \"This is embarrassing, a process like this.\"\\nLast Saturday, Obama hit McCain especially hard, after his 2008 presidential rival declared a major setback in the Iran nuclear talks after Iran\\'s supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, demanded that sanctions against Tehran had to be lifted immediately after a deal went into place. (The preliminary deal says the sanctions will be lifted as Iran proves it is complying with limits on its nuclear program.)\\nObama cast McCain\\'s criticism as an assault on the credibility of Secretary of State John Kerry.\\n\"That\\'s an indication of the degree to which partisanship has crossed all boundaries,\" Obama said. \"That\\'s a problem.

Obama and his aides \"have come to understand that you don\\'t get the attention of these guys and the attention of the country without having some edge.\"\\nRepublicans maintain Obama would be better off working on bipartisan efforts, such as trade.

Chris Christie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trade mission to London was suddenly overshadowed on Monday after he was quoted as saying that parents \\xe2\\x80\\x9cneed to have some measure of choice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d about vaccinating their children against measles. The New Jersey governor, who is trying to establish his credibility among conservatives as he weighs a run for the Republican nomination in 2016, later tried to temper his response. His office released a statement clarifying that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwith a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSenator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a physician, was less equivocal, telling the conservative radio host Laura Ingraham on Monday that parents should absolutely have a say in whether to vaccinate their children for measles.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhile I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good idea to take the vaccine, I think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a personal decision for individuals,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, recalling his irritation at doctors who tried to press him to vaccinate his own children. He eventually did, he said, but spaced out the vaccinations over a period of time.\\nThe vaccination controversy is a twist on an old problem for the Republican Party: how to approach matters that have largely been settled among scientists but are not widely accepted by conservatives.\\nIt is a dance Republican candidates often do when they hedge their answers about whether evolution should be taught in schools. It is what makes the fight over global warming such a liability for their party, and what led last year to a widely criticized response to the Ebola scare.\\nAs concern spread about an Ebola outbreak in the United States, physicians criticized Republican lawmakers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including Mr. Christie \\xe2\\x80\\x94 who called for strict quarantines of people who may have been exposed to the virus. In some cases, Republicans proposed banning people who had been to the hardest-hit West African countries from entering the United States, even though public health officials warned that would only make it more difficult to stop Ebola\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spread.\\nOn climate change, the party has struggled with how to position itself, with some Republicans inviting mockery for questioning the established science that human activity is contributing to rising temperatures and sea levels.\\nThere is evidence that vaccinations have become more of a political issue in recent years. Pew Research Center polls show that in 2009, 71 percent of both Republicans and Democrats favored requiring the vaccination of children. Five years later, Democratic support had grown to 76 percent, but Republican support had fallen to 65 percent.\\nThe debate does not break entirely along right-left lines. The movement to forgo vaccinations has been popular in more liberal and affluent communities where some parents are worried that vaccines cause autism or other disorders among children.\\nPresident Obama acknowledged the concern as a candidate in 2008. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome people are suspicious that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s connected to the vaccines, this person included,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, pointing to a member of the crowd, and he did later go on to say that the issue warranted further study.

Two, is entitled people who don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to put any poison in their kids and view this as poison, which is ignorance more than anything else. And three, people who are antigovernment in any way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut the truth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added Mr. Dean, a physician, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis you can be conservative without putting kids in harm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe issue has more political potency among conservative voters who are highly skeptical of anything required by the government.\\nThe vaccine question  surfaced in the 2012 Republican primary when rivals of Rick Perry, then the Texas governor, pounced on him for issuing an executive order requiring sixth-grade girls to be vaccinated against the human papillomavirus \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the first regulation of its kind in the country.

That may seem low, but in today\\'s dollars it was $10.86.\\nVerdict: True\\nBernie Sanders\\nReality Check: Sanders on vets with PTSD\\nBy Debra Goldschmidt, CNN Health\\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said, \"When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let\\'s talk about the men and women who came home from war, the 500,000 who came home with PTSD and traumatic brain injury.\"\\nRoughly 2.6 million veterans served in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs says 11% to 20% of military members who served in Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from PTSD.\\nAccording to a Veteran Affairs independent study on traumatic brain injury, self-reported data found 15% of troops who were engaged in active combat in Afghanistan and Iraq \"may have suffered\" a mild traumatic brain injury. This falls in line with a report from the Brain Trauma Foundation, which found between 10% to 20% of Iraq veterans suffer from some level of traumatic brain disorder.\\nVerdict: True\\nReality Check: Sanders on Muslim countries fighting ISIS\\nBy Eve Bower, CNN\\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said, \"The Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan -- all of these nations, they\\'re going to have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground. They are going to have to take on ISIS. ... Those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort. They are not doing it now.\"\\nLaunched in September 2014, the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS consists of more than 60 coalition partners, including more than a dozen Muslim-majority countries. All of the countries Sanders mentioned are part of that coalition -- with the exception of Iran, which has been countering ISIS in separate initiatives that include training, advising, and supporting Iraqi and Syrian forces fighting ISIS.\\nThe actual contributions of each member of the U.S.-led coalition vary widely. As of October 2014, Saudi Arabia\\'s contribution consisted of warplanes and training for Syrian rebels fighting ISIS. They also donated $500 million to UN humanitarian efforts in Iraq. Turkey has allowed foreign troops to launch attacks against ISIS from within its borders, and in July, began launching its own airstrikes against ISIS in Syria. Jordan launched airstrikes against ISIS early in the campaign, but later suspended its participation when one of its aircraft went down in Syria and one of its pilots was taken hostage. Jordanian strikes resumed after ISIS announced it had killed the Jordanian pilot.\\nFew of the coalition\\'s members have contributed active ground troops. In 2014, Egypt sent forces to Libya to bomb ISIS positions there. In late October, the United States authorized the deployment of about 50 special operations forces to northern Syria to fight ISIS. The Obama administration is also considering a special forces task force to fight ISIS in Iraq.\\nIn June of 2014, Iraqi officials said that Iran had sent about 500 Revolutionary Guard troops to fight alongside Iraqi troops against ISIS. The Iranian Foreign Ministry denied this, but Iran\\'s president said Iran was prepared to help advise Iraq if asked.\\nSanders is correct that, at present, the primary coalition fighting ISIS is led by the United States. But several of the Muslim countries in the coalition have lost soldiers and civilians in the battle against ISIS.\\nVerdict: True, but misleading\\nMartin O\\'Malley\\nReality Check: O\\'Malley on net immigration from Mexico\\nBy Sonam Vashi, CNN\\nFormer Gov. Martin O\\'Malley said, \"The truth of the matter is net immigration from Mexico last year was zero.\" He then challenged viewers to fact-check him, and we couldn\\'t resist.\\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, net migration from Mexico probably reached zero in 2010, and more Mexicans have left the United States than arrived since then.\\nAdditionally, the actual number of Mexicans living in the United States consistently declined throughout 2014. The U.S. Border Patrol also reported that in the 2014 fiscal year, the number of Mexicans apprehended along the border decreased 14% when compared to the 2013 fiscal year.\\nThe information we have suggests that the net immigration rate is negative -- which is actually not zero -- but it is close, and probably still supports O\\'Malley\\'s point.\\nVerdict: True\\nReality Check: O\\'Malley on Maryland\\'s median income\\nBy Tom LoBianco and Tami Luhby, CNN\\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O\\'Malley often goes back to his record as governor to explain how he would best shepherd the nation\\'s economy in the White House. But he went a step further than he typically does during Saturday night\\'s debate and took credit for Maryland\\'s high median incomes.\\nO\\'Malley was answering a question of how precisely he would freeze college tuition around the nation and whether his blueprint from Maryland would work across the U.S.\\n\"The blueprint in Maryland that we followed is we raised the sales tax by a penny and made our public schools the best public schools in America for five years in a row with that investment. And yes, we did ask everyone -- the top 14% of earners in our state -- to pay more in their income tax and we were the only state to go four years in a row without a penny\\'s increase to college tuitions,\" O\\'Malley said.\\nThe answer, nationwide, is paying for priorities by taxing capital gains income like normal income, he said.\\n\"I believe capital gains, for the most part, should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work, sweat and toil,\" O\\'Malley said. \"And if we do those things, we can be a country that actually can afford debt-free college again.\"\\nBut in the exchange he also took credit for the state\\'s median income level -- long the highest in the nation.\\n\"So while other candidates will talk about the things they would like to do, I actually got these things they would like to do. I actually got these things done in a state that defended not only a AAA bond rating, but the highest median income in America,\" O\\'Malley said.\\nThere\\'s no question that Marylanders have done, on average, much better than those in other states since the recession. It\\'s actually had the highest median income every year since 2006, when the median income was $65,144, to last year, when it was $73,971.\\nIn his answer, O\\'Malley did not explain how his economic plan kept high-wage jobs in Maryland.\\nBut President Barack Obama and former President George W. Bush may be better able to make that claim because of the large share of federal employees in Maryland. A \"Governing\" magazine analysis of federal employment statistics from 2013 determined that Maryland had the largest share of federal workers for the total workforce of any state, something that the governor has nothing to do with.\\nMaryland had 145,300 people working for the government, equal to 5.5% of the state\\'s total non-farm employment. Virginia had more federal employees -- 172,500 -- but they only accounted for 4.6% of the total state employment.\\nAnd a Washington Post review of federal salaries found that federal workers do quite well compared to many other industries -- earning an average salary of $78,500 as of 2012.\\nVerdict: False' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'Washington (CNN)Real estate mogul and billionaire Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he is forming a presidential exploratory committee.\\nThe announcement comes weeks after Trump hired political operatives in key early primary states and marks the most concrete step yet that Trump in seriously considering a presidential run, something he\\'s hinted at doing for years.\\nTrump has repeatedly flirted with the idea of running for president, most recently in the leadup to the 2012 election when he said he was seriously considering jumping into the Republican fray. Trump previously launched an exploratory committee in 1999 as he considered running for president then.\\nAfter garnering media attention and leading in some early polls, Trump ultimately backed out and endorsed former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney for president.\\nThat\\'s a decision Trump has appeared to regret recently, saying Romney \"choked\" in 2012. Trump has also knocked former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, the Republican establishment frontrunner: \"The last thing we need is another Bush,\" he said in Iowa earlier this year.\\nDespite naysayers who point out that Trump perpetually teases at running for president for self promoting purposes, the mogul has said he talked with several potential contenders for the Republican presidential nomination -- would-be foes for a man who says he\\'s more serious than ever about a presidential run.\\nAnd he also announced that his NBC \"Celebrity Apprentice\" show has been renewed for a 15th season. He and his aides later explained that while NBC has offered to renew the reality TV show, he has not signed any papers and could back out.\\n\"They want to renew it and I told them I have to put it on hold because I\\'m doing something that\\'s far more important,\" Trump told CNN in an interview at the Conservative Political Action Conference late last month -- just over a week after he promoted the show\\'s renewal on Twitter.\\nHe said NBC had not given him a deadline to make up his mind.\\nTrump also drew skeptical glances from conservatives who flocked to CPAC as he once again raised the issue of President Barack Obama\\'s birth certificate, again questioning its authenticity.\\nAnd on his meetings and discussions with likely 2016 Republican candidates, like Gov.

      "features:b'Austerity may be starting to squeeze the life out of the job market.\\nU.S. employers hired at the slowest pace in nearly a year in March, adding only 88,000 jobs to non-farm payrolls, with steep job cuts in the retail and government sectors, including 12,000 at the U.S. Postal Service, according to a Labor Department report released Friday.\\nEconomists predicted March\\'s net gain to be somewhere closer to 190,000, according to a Bloomberg survey.\\n\"This is a punch to the gut,\" Austan Goolsbee, former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under President Obama, said on CNBC. \"This is not a good number.\"\\n(SCROLL DOWN FOR UPDATES AND ANALYSIS ON THE REPORT)\\nUnemployment fell to 7.6 percent in March from 7.7 percent in February, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. But that was mainly due to 496,000 people leaving the labor force completely. The labor-force participation rate -- the percentage of people eligible to be working or looking for work -- fell to 63.3 percent, the lowest since 1979. Had that number simply held stable, the unemployment rate might have been higher.\\nStocks, which have recently climbed to fresh record highs, sold off after the report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 150 points, or 1 percent, shortly after the market opened, while the S&P 500 was down 1.1 percent. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes tumbled below 1.7 percent, their lowest levels of the year, as investors rushed for safety. Treasury yields fall as their prices rise.\\nNon-farm payrolls have grown by 504,000 jobs in the first three months of the year, or 168,000 per month, just enough to keep up with the natural growth of the labor force and keep unemployment from rising. February\\'s top-line number was revised up to 268,000. Together, revisions to January and February added 61,000 jobs -- the one thin silver lining in an otherwise dismal report.\\nMarch\\'s jobs numbers did not yet reflect much of the \"sequester,\" the across-the-board federal budget cuts that will slowly take effect throughout the year, resulting in less hiring and fewer hours worked by government employees. Nevertheless, austerity is already pinching job growth in other ways. The federal government shed 14,000 jobs in March, almost all of which were accounted for by the U.S. Postal Service.\\nMeanwhile, the retail sector shed 24,000 jobs, possibly an effect of the payroll-tax hike that was part of the \"fiscal cliff\" settlement at the beginning of the year.\\nA weak labor market meant that average hourly earnings for private-sector workers rose by just a penny in March, to $23.82 from $23.81. Worker earnings have gained just 1.8 percent in the past year, not enough to keep up with inflation -- even as corporate profits and the stock market have soared to record highs.\\nWith Congress focused on cutting the federal budget deficit, the Federal Reserve has been doing much of the heavy lifting in trying to stimulate the economy, buying $85 billion in bonds per month to keep longer-term interest rates low. It has promised to keep doing that until it sees substantial improvement in the labor market.\\nThe economy has added nearly 5.9 million jobs in total since the job market bottomed in February 2010, but it is still about 2.9 million jobs away from its peak level of non-farm employment in January 2008. This grinding recovery has been the slowest since World War II.\\nOne reason for the drag has been austerity in federal, state and local governments, which have cut 605,000 jobs since February 2010, a drag on the job market\\'s growth, even as private-sector employers have added nearly 6.5 million jobs.\\n\"Sharp cuts in government spending implemented March 1 are only beginning to show their ugly consequences,\" Heather Boushey, an economist with the liberal think-tank Center for American Progress, said in an email. \"While it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too early to know what the full impact will be on the unemployment rate, government spending cuts are stealing wind from the sails of the recovery.\"' target:-1\n",

I don\\'t care why he said it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there\\'s no excuse and it warrants an immediate apology,\" he said.\\nYoung, Alaska\\'s sole congressman, originally made the comment during a sit-down interview with Ketchikan Public Radio earlier this week. Talking about how technology is affecting the economy, he referenced an anecdote from his family\\'s farm in California.\\n\"My father had a ranch; we used to have 50-60 wetbacks to pick tomatoes,\" Young said. \"It takes two people to pick the same tomatoes now. It\\'s all done by machine.\"\\nYoung issued a statement Thursday to a local television station in Anchorage, which didn\\'t come as a full apology but sought to clarify his reasoning behind using the word.\\n\"I used a term that was commonly used during my days growing up on a farm in Central California,\" he said. \"I know that this term is not used in the same way nowadays and I meant no disrespect.\"\\nThe word is widely considered an ethnic slur and generally refers to those from Mexico who come to the United States illegally by crossing the Rio Grande River. It was used by the government in the 1950s for \"Operation Wetback,\" a massive crackdown on illegal immigration along the U.S.-Mexico border.\\nBut on the heels of a new Republican push to expand its outreach to minorities, especially Latinos, Democrats were quick to point out the comment as damaging\\xe2\\x80\\x93and similar reactions from Republicans started rolling in, as well.\\nRepublican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said Young\\'s words \"emphatically\" don\\'t represent the party.\\n\"Our party represents freedom and opportunity for every American and a beacon of hope to those seeking liberty throughout the world,\" he said in a statement. \"Offensive language and ethnic slurs have no place in our public discourse.\"\\nSen. John Cornyn of Texas, the number two Republican in the upper chamber, was also quick to seek distance from the comment. He blasted Young in a statement, saying migrant workers come to the country for work and opportunities, not to \"hear ethnic slurs and derogatory language from elected officials.\"\\n\"The comments used by Rep. Young do nothing to elevate our party, political discourse or the millions who come here looking for economic opportunity,\" he continued.\\nSen. John McCain, one of the leading GOP voices on immigration reform, said on Twitter that Young\\'s comments \"were offensive and have no place in our Party or in our nation\\'s discourse.\"\\n\"He should apologize immediately,\" he added.\\nThe party\\'s tone on immigration became a focal point in the GOP\\'s self-review following November\\'s presidential election. One of the most talked-about issues was Mitt Romney\\'s position in favor of \"self-deportation,\" where undocumented immigrants would voluntarily leave, go home and get in the back of the line to re-apply for entry into the country.\\nIn a report released earlier in March by the RNC, which showed the results of its months-long review after Election Day, the party described such language as harmful to the party\\'s image and ability to connect with voters that generally fall outside of the GOP column.\\n\"If Hispanic Americans perceive that a GOP nominee or candidate does not want them in the United States (i.e. self-deportation), they will not pay attention to our next sentence,\" the report stated. In one of its few policy recommendations, the report advised Republicans to \"embrace and champion\" comprehensive immigration reform.\\nAnd GOP Gov.

      "features:b'DALLAS \\xe2\\x80\\x94 A nurse here became the first person to contract Ebola within the United States, prompting local, state and federal officials who had settled into a choreographed response to scramble on Sunday to solve the mystery of how she became infected, despite wearing protective gear, and to monitor additional people possibly at risk.\\nThe news further stoked fears of health care workers across the country, many of whom have grown increasingly anxious about having to handle Ebola cases. The confirmation on Sunday of the second Ebola case in Dallas \\xe2\\x80\\x94 four days after the death on Wednesday of the first patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, a Liberian who arrived in this country in September \\xe2\\x80\\x94 opened a new and more frightening chapter in the unfolding public health drama.\\nWhile the new Ebola patient was not publicly identified, officials said that she was a nurse who had helped treat Mr. Duncan at a hospital here and that she may have violated safety protocols. It was the first confirmed instance of Ebola being transmitted in this country. Officials expanded the pool of people they had been monitoring, because the nurse had not been among the 48 health care workers, relatives of Mr. Duncan and others whom they were evaluating daily.\\nThe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that health officials look more closely at the protective gear that nurses, doctors and hospital assistants use when treating Ebola patients. It also, for the first time, was considering the idea that patients with the virus should be transferred to hospitals with special containment units and experience in treating the disease.\\nThe Dallas hospital at the center of the two Ebola cases, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, was facing renewed scrutiny over whether it had properly trained its workers. It sent Mr. Duncan home on Sept. 25 under the belief he had a sinus infection, only to have him return Sept. 28 when his conditions worsened.\\nThe C.D.C. said it would conduct a nationwide training conference call on Tuesday for thousands of health care workers to ensure they would be fully prepared to treat a patient with Ebola.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe care of Ebola patients can be done safely, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to do it safely,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the C.D.C., told reporters Sunday. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEven a single, inadvertent innocent slip can result in contamination.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe stricken nurse reported a low-grade fever overnight Friday, officials said. It appeared that she drove herself to the emergency room of Presbyterian Hospital, where she worked, and was admitted and put in isolation 90 minutes later, the officials said.\\nShe had extensive contact with Mr. Duncan on multiple occasions after his second visit and admission to the hospital on Sept. 28, Dr. Frieden said.\\nThe nurse had been monitoring herself for symptoms of Ebola, under a regimen prescribed by the C.D.C. Health officials will now investigate who had been in contact with Mr. Duncan after he was admitted to the hospital and while he was in isolation, Dr. Frieden said.\\nBefore her trip to the emergency room, officials said, the nurse had not been at work for two days. A preliminary blood test was done at the state public health lab in Austin, and the positive result was received late Saturday evening, officials said. Late Sunday afternoon, the C.D.C. confirmed that she had Ebola after completing its own tests.\\nThe woman was in stable condition on Sunday. Dr. Daniel Varga, chief clinical officer of Texas Health Resources, which oversees Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, told reporters on Sunday that the worker had worn protective gear when coming in contact with Mr. Duncan, although he did not detail the type of contact.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis individual was following full C.D.C. precautions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Varga said, adding, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGown, glove, mask and shield.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Asked how concerned he was that the worker tested positive despite the precautions, he replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re very concerned.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nDespite Dr. Varga\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reassurances about C.D.C. precautions having been followed, Dr. Frieden said it appeared that the woman had breached safety protocol at the hospital, possibly when removing the protective gear. Speaking on the CBS program \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFace the Nation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and later at a news conference, he said that questioning of the worker had not identified precisely how a breach occurred, and that the cause of her infection was not known. Dr. Frieden said that everyone who had treated Mr. Duncan was now considered to be potentially exposed and that other cases of Ebola were possible.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re deeply concerned about this new development,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said on the talk show.\\nThe C.D.C. has said that for health workers in the United States, gloves, gowns, masks and face shields or goggles would be protection enough. But many health workers across the country, seeing images of people in Africa completely encased in full-body hazardous-material suits, have requested similar protection.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA lot of us are starting to get worried,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Debra Buccellato, an emergency room nurse in Santa Rosa, Calif. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a single mom, so if I got sick there\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be a huge void.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMs. Buccellato, 38, said supervisors at her hospital had distributed information about C.D.C. guidelines, but added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have not seen any active training or practice drills, and I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen any new or upgraded personal protective equipment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nShe said that she had emailed her manager to ask for more training, but that she was not sure that hazardous-material suits were the best option for her 90-bed facility, Sutter Santa Rosa Hospital.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how realistic it is to go to that level when you have X amount of patients to take care of and time issues,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Buccellato said.

Mr. Obama was briefed by Lisa Monaco, the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assistant for homeland security, and then spoke by telephone with Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services.\\nWhile other patients with Ebola have been treated in the United States in recent weeks, the nurse is only the second person \\xe2\\x80\\x94 after Mr. Duncan \\xe2\\x80\\x94 whose condition was diagnosed in the United States.

Police officers were prohibiting access to her apartment. Officials believe the woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pet dog was inside the apartment, but was doing fine.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have a plan in place to take care of the pet, and we do not believe that pet has any signs, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll move accordingly later today,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mayor Mike Rawlings of Dallas said.\\nRemaining calm was easier said than done for many of the woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s neighbors.

      "features:b'\\'MediaBuzz\\' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on why CNN is standing by a Michael Cohen story that his lawyer, Lanny Davis, says is false.\\nLanny Davis, who has been engaged in high-stakes crisis management and political lawyering for decades, says he made a mistake.\\nCNN, which relied on Davis at least in part for a story he now says is false, won&apost say it made a mistake.\\nAnd the contretemps contains a revealing look at the sausage-making of investigative reporting and the sometimes murky dance between reporters and their unnamed sources.\\nDavis, who I&aposve found to be a straight shooter over a quarter century dating back to the Clinton scandals, told me in a telephone interview yesterday that he had made an error and regrets it.\\n\"I should not be talking to reporters on background about something I&aposm not certain about,\" Davis told me, describing his interactions with CNN reporters. \"The combination of big stakes and a big mistake is a bad moment for me. If I had a redo in life, I wouldn&apost have said anything about the subject.\"\\nHe added: \"I don&apost blame anyone other than myself.\"\\nAfter initially saying nothing, here is the sum total of CNN&aposs comment: \"We stand by our story, and are confident in our reporting of it.\" A CNN report yesterday said that Davis kept changing his story in his dealings with the network.\\nHere&aposs the backstory: CNN dropped a bombshell last month by reporting that Davis&apos client, Michael Cohen, had information that Donald Trump knew in advance of the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between his son, his son-in-law, campaign chairman and a Russian lawyer. \"Cohen is willing to make that assertion to special counsel Robert Mueller,\" according to \"the sources,\" CNN said.\\nThe president has repeatedly denied any advance knowledge of the meeting.\\nThe story, whose bylines included Carl Bernstein and Jim Sciutto, was picked up by the broadcast networks and many other major media organizations.\\nBut now Davis has outed himself as an anonymous source for CNN, and says Cohen has no such information about advance knowledge by the president.\\nIn my interview, Davis said he told CNN reporters that he couldn&apost confirm the Trump Tower allegation but encouraged them to check it out. He now believes they may have interpreted this as giving them a green light.\\n\"When I work for a client, whether it&aposs the White House or anybody else, and there&aposs something that might be true but I&aposm not sure, I have to not expect reporters to get it right,\" Davis told me. He said he should have been more explicit in telling the CNN journalists not to pursue an unsubstantiated story.\\nDavis added that he did not intentionally mislead CNN&aposs Anderson Cooper in saying he wasn&apost a source for the network. He meant that he wasn&apost a confirming source on the Trump Tower allegation and says he should have been more clear.\\nImplicit in CNN standing by the story is that the network has other sources for the Trump Tower allegation. But how could others have information about what Cohen believes when the president&aposs former lawyer is essentially saying, through Davis, that he has no such information?\\nCohen, of course, pleaded guilty last week to bank fraud, tax evasion and campaign finance violations related to hush money payments to two women making accusations against Trump.\\nThe president, of course, has boasted about Davis&apos admission on Twitter.\\nThe Washington Post handled its dealings with Davis very differently. The Post had also dealt with him as an unnamed source.\\nAs the paper recounts, the day after the CNN story, \"The Post reported that Cohen had told associates that he witnessed an exchange in which Trump Jr. told his father about an upcoming gathering in which he expected to get information about Clinton. The Post did not report that Trump Jr. told his father that the information was coming from Russians.\\n\"The information in the Post story, which was attributed to one person familiar with discussions among Cohen&aposs friends, came from Davis, who is now acknowledging his role on the record.\"\\nAnd that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the thing. CNN doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to protect Davis, who has come clean about his role in the matter.\\nWhen the White House makes a mistake or clings to an unsubstantiated charge, news organizations hammer top officials about it. Shouldn&apost a network have the same obligation to explain itself when an explosive story is denied by one of its own sources?\\nDavis says he has learned a valuable lesson, and is \"pulling back\" on other claims he has made. The Washington lawyer told MSNBC&aposs Rachel Maddow there were indications that Trump knew in advance of the hacking of Democratic emails.\\nHe said that was his belief but that he had no hard evidence to back it up.\\nLanny Davis has owned up to his mistake.

      "features:b'Donald Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s travel ban now appears to be a permanent part of US immigration policy.\\nOn Tuesday, in an opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court ruled for the government in Trump v. Hawaii, the lawsuit over the current version of the travel ban \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the third that the Trump administration has issued since it made its first effort in January 2017.\\nIn a 5-4 decision (the court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s liberals dissented), Roberts reversed the ruling of the 9th Circuit Court that had attempted to put the travel ban on hold \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a ruling that the Supreme Court had already kept from going into effect while it reviewed the case \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and sent the case back to the 9th Circuit to reconsider.\\nRelated\\nThe current version, which prevents some (or all) immigrants, refugees, and visa holders from Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen from entering the US, has been in full effect since early December (thanks to an earlier Supreme Court ruling). For a full explanation of how the case has developed, see Vox\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Trump v. Hawaii explainer.\\nThe existing ban is much narrower than Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first attempts \\xe2\\x80\\x94 thanks in part to early court defeats in 2017, it only applies to certain categories of visa applicants (depending on country) and theoretically allows for would-be immigrants to apply for waivers.\\nBut it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also designed to be permanent.\\nIn theory, the legal fight over the travel ban isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t over, since the Supreme Court is still instructing the 9th Circuit to rule on the merits of the ban. But by decreeing that the legal challenges to the ban aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\xe2\\x80\\x9clikely to succeed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on the merits, the court has just made it extremely difficult for the ban to get struck down in future.\\nLegally, the court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision rested on two conclusions.\\nFirst of all, it found that indefinitely banning people from particular countries was a lawful use of the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s power under the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the executive branch to suspend the entry of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclass\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of people if the government \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfinds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe language of \\xc2\\xa71182(f) is clear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Roberts wrote, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand the Proclamation does not exceed any textual limit on the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s authority.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nHawaii and the other states challenging the ban argued that because another line in the same section of the law prevents the government from discriminating in immigration policy based on nationality, it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t legal to use the suspension provision against whole countries\\xe2\\x80\\x99 worth of entrants.\\nSecond of all, the court found that the travel ban did not violate the First Amendment by denying freedom of religion to Muslims. In other words, it found that the travel ban was not, in fact, a Muslim ban.\\nThe central question over the 17 months of litigation over various iterations of the travel ban has been about whether Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s December 2015 campaign promise of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims\\xe2\\x80\\x9d entering the United States (which the Trump administration has all but acknowledged would be unconstitutional) is still at the heart of the travel ban. But because he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make that statement as president, the administration argued, it shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t count against him.\\nThe Supreme Court has generally deferred to the executive branch, especially on immigration, if the government can produce a rationale for the policy that isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t discriminatory.\\nThe Trump administration argued that the third version of the travel ban was a well-thought-through process solely based on security concerns about information-sharing.

      "features:b'President Obama says the May 8 House hearing on Benghazi and subsequent reporting about it produced no new information. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largely the case, but the president misrepresented some facts at his May 13 press conference in dismissing the House investigation as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpolitical circus.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nChanges to the Talking Points\\nThe White House and Republicans have been at odds for nearly eight months over the talking points used by Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, when she appeared on several Sunday talk shows five days after the Sept. 11, 2012, attack in Benghazi. Rice used talking points written by the CIA that said the attack \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens \\xe2\\x80\\x94 started \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspontaneously\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as a protest.\\nRice, for example, told CBS News\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFace the Nation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on Sept. 16 that the attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi began \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspontaneously \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 as a reaction to what had transpired some hours earlier in Cairo where, of course, as you know, there was a violent protest outside of our embassy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 sparked by this hateful video.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She was referring to a protest at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, where demonstrators scaled the walls and removed a U.S. flag in protest of an anti-Muslim video produced in the United States.\\nBut Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim about a spontaneous demonstration in Benghazi proved to be false. Many Republicans \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including Sen. John McCain, the party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presidential nominee in 2008 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 have charged the White House with engaging in an election-year cover-up by blaming the anti-Muslim video for the Benghazi attack, rather than acknowledging it was a premeditated terrorist attack carried out on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to note that all the evidence \\xe2\\x80\\x94 then and now \\xe2\\x80\\x94 shows that the talking points always said that the attack grew out of a spontaneous demonstration in response to the Cairo protests. That was in the original draft of the talking points, and it remained in the final draft. There has been no evidence showing an election-year cover-up.\\nIt has been known since at least late November that Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talking points were changed. CBS News reported on Nov. 20, 2012, that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not the White House nor the State Department \\xe2\\x80\\x94 removed references to al Qaeda and terrorism from talking points given to Rice. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security issued a bipartisan report on Dec. 30, 2012, confirming that the talking points had been changed, and that the White House and State Department were not involved. But the report also said that it failed to get a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfull account\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of what changes were made, who made them and why \\xe2\\x80\\x94 despite \\xe2\\x80\\x9crepeated requests\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for that information.\\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney repeatedly has said that the White House and State Department changed only one word of the talking points.\\nThat has been proven demonstrably false \\xe2\\x80\\x94 first by a May 3 report in the Weekly Standard and later by a more detailed May 10 report by ABC News. Both news reports show the CIA made many deletions and alterations in response to State Department comments, including removing references to other recent attacks on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cforeign interests\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in Benghazi and a reference to the al Qaeda-linked Ansar al-Sharia group as possibly being involved.\\nOn May 8, the day of the House committee hearing on Benghazi, Carney was asked about the Weekly Standard report. He reiterated his statement that White House involvement was minimal when asked, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWere you incorrect when you said that only a single word had been changed?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nCarney may be technically correct to say the CIA was the entity that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdrafted\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9credrafted\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the talking points \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a House GOP report on the matter said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe actual edits were made by a current high-ranking CIA official.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But the Weekly Standard and ABC News reports describe how changes were made after the State Department objected. To say that the State Department made a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csingle adjustment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to the wording, as Carney claimed, is misleading at best. It glosses over the State Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extensive involvement in the editing process.\\nABC News published 12 drafts of the talking points. All of the drafts say the attack began \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspontaneously\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in response to a violent protest in Cairo (which was sparked by the anti-Muslim video). But the original CIA talking points said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe do know that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qa\\xe2\\x80\\x99ida participated in the attack.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And they said that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[i]nitial press reporting linked the attack to Ansar al-Sharia.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe final draft, used by Rice, in her appearances on political talk shows on Sept. 16, 2012, would only say that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cextremists participated.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rice, reflecting the talking points, said it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t clear if al Qaeda or al Qaeda affiliates were involved.\\nABC News \\xe2\\x80\\x94 based on reporter Jonathan Karl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s review of administration emails and the drafts of the talking points \\xe2\\x80\\x93reported that State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland objected to including the names of terrorist groups, saying \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to prejudice the investigation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nABC News also reported that the emails \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which were released by the administration five days later on May 15 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 showed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe State Department had extensive input into the editing of the talking points,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d including the removal of a reference to CIA warnings of al Qaeda-linked threats in Benghazi.\\nThat paragraph was deleted after a Saturday morning meeting at the White House. ABC News later updated its report to say that \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca source familiar with the White House emails\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said that Nuland was concerned that the talking points went beyond what she could say at State Department briefings and that, ABC News said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe believed the CIA was attempting to exonerate itself at the State Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expense by suggesting CIA warnings about the security situation were ignored.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nDespite all this, Carney stuck to his story in a May 10 press briefing on the day ABC News published its report. Reporters peppered him with questions about how he could describe these changes as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstylistic and non-substantive.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He repeatedly said that it was the CIA that made the changes, and that the only edit made by the White House was the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconsulate\\xe2\\x80\\x9d/\\xe2\\x80\\x9ddiplomatic facility\\xe2\\x80\\x9d change. Carney said it was standard procedure for there to be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinputs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from various agencies.\\nCarney pointed to the Ansar al-Sharia information as speculative at the time, or information that the CIA \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccould not be concretely sure of.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And indeed, the original CIA talking points said that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinitial press reporting\\xe2\\x80\\x9d linked the group to the attack. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe group has since released a statement that its leadership did not order the attacks, but did not deny that some of its members were involved,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the original draft said.\\nCarney also said that the State Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s objections had to do with the talking points going further \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin assigning responsibility than preliminary assessments suggested, and there was concern about preserving the integrity of the investigation. That concern was expressed in other quarters, not just at the State Department.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut Carney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s initial statement about a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csingle adjustment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d gave a false impression about the State Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role in developing the final talking points.\\nCongressional Review of Changes to Talking Points\\nAsked if \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnewly public emails show that the White House and the State Department appear to have been more closely involved with the crafting of the talking points on the attack than first acknowledged,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the president said \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccongressional committees\\xe2\\x80\\x9d reviewed those same emails and concluded there was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnothing afoul.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWe asked the White House what congressional committees came to that conclusion and when, because, as we briefly noted earlier, the Senate report on Benghazi said the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee did not receive \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca full account of the changes made to the talking points, by whom they were made and why.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The committee sought a timeline of the changes, but the report said it \\xe2\\x80\\x9chas not been delivered as promised because the Administration has spent weeks debating internally whether or not it should turn over information considered \\xe2\\x80\\x98deliberative\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to the Congress.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn response to our request, the White House referred us to a closed-door meeting on Feb. 26 attended by Senate Intelligence Committee members, who were allowed to review the emails as part of their consideration of John Brennan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nomination as CIA director. Specifically, the White House noted that GOP Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina said after the meeting that the review of the emails \\xe2\\x80\\x9canswers a lot, if not all, of the questions that the committee [had] from an oversight standpoint.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It also noted that Brennan was confirmed.\\nBut Burr\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinion wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t shared by all on the Senate Intelligence Committee.\\nSen.

She said after the meeting: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI still have many concerns and believe there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still gaps in the information.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rubio, another Republican on Senate Intelligence Committee, said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think it raises other questions with regard to process.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nCollins appeared on CNN\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cState of the Union\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on May 12, and she was asked by CNN\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Candy Crowley whether she learned anything new about Benghazi. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI did learn something new,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere were further iterations and changes in the talking points than I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been aware of.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nObama and \\xe2\\x80\\x98Act of Terror\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nAt his press conference, Obama expressed frustration with those who label the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s initial response to the attack a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccover-up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe day after it happened, I acknowledged that this was an act of terrorism.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nNot quite.

      "features:b'The New York State attorney general\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office filed a scathingly worded lawsuit on Thursday taking aim at the Donald J. Trump Foundation, accusing the charity and the Trump family of sweeping violations of campaign finance laws, self-dealing and illegal coordination with the presidential campaign.\\nThe lawsuit, which seeks to dissolve the foundation and bar President Trump and three of his children from serving on nonprofit organizations, was an extraordinary rebuke of a sitting president. The attorney general also sent referral letters to the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission for possible further action, adding to Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extensive legal challenges.\\nThe lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, culminated a nearly two-year investigation of Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charity, which became a subject of scrutiny during and after the 2016 presidential campaign. While such foundations are supposed to be devoted to charitable activities, the petition asserts that Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s was often improperly used to settle legal claims against his various businesses, even spending $10,000 on a portrait of Mr. Trump that was hung at one of his golf clubs.\\nThe foundation was also used to curry political favor, the lawsuit asserts. During the 2016 race, the foundation became a virtual arm of Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign, email traffic showed, with his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, directing its expenditures, even though such foundations are explicitly prohibited from political activities.\\nThe attorney general\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office is seeking the Trump Foundation to pay $2.8 million in restitution, the amount raised for the foundation at a 2016 Iowa political fund-raiser. At the time, Mr. Trump skipped a Republican debate and set up his own event to raise money for veterans, though he used the event to skewer his opponents and celebrate his own accomplishments.\\nMr. Trump immediately attacked the lawsuit, characterizing it in a Twitter post as an attempt by the \\xe2\\x80\\x9csleazy New York Democrats\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to damage him by suing the foundation, and vowing not to settle the case \\xe2\\x80\\x94 much as he did when the same office filed a lawsuit accusing Trump University. (Mr. Trump in 2016 paid a $25 million settlement to resolve the inquiry.)\\nThe $10,000 portrait of Mr. Trump was one of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cat least five self-dealing transactions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d facilitated by the foundation, according to the attorney general\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office, violating tax regulations that prohibit using nonprofit charities for private interests.\\nIn 2007, to settle a dispute between the City of Palm Beach and Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Mar-a-Lago resort, the foundation paid $100,000 to the Fisher House Foundation, another charity.\\nIn 2012, a man named Martin B. Greenberg sued the Trump National Golf Club after he made a hole in one at a fund-raising golf tournament that had promised to pay $1 million to golfers who aced the 13th hole, as he did. As part of a settlement, the charitable foundation paid $158,000 to a foundation run by Mr. Greenberg.\\nThe foundation also paid $5,000 to one organization for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpromotional space featuring Trump International Hotels,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and another $32,000 to satisfy a pledge made by a privately held entity controlled by Mr. Trump to a charitable land trust.\\n[For more on the foundation: The Donald J. Trump Foundation, Explained]\\nThe foundation lawsuit, and the referrals to the federal agencies, are the latest of Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voluminous legal challenges, starting with the ongoing investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into ties between Mr. Trump, his associates and Russia.\\nThe attorney general\\xe2\\x80\\x99s action is also likely to embolden critics who have accused Mr. Trump of flouting legal norms. Mr. Trump has suggested he might pardon himself in the Mueller investigation and has repeatedly assailed the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs our investigation reveals, the Trump Foundation was little more than a checkbook for payments from Mr. Trump or his businesses to nonprofits, regardless of their purpose or legality,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Barbara D. Underwood, New York\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attorney general, who has been on the job a little over a month. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is not how private foundations should function and my office intends to hold the foundation accountable for its misuse of charitable assets.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMany of the examples cited in the lawsuit were first reported by The Washington Post.\\nNumerous state and federal laws preclude nonprofit organizations and charities like the Trump Foundation from lobbying, aiding a political campaign, or giving undue benefits that further a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self-interests, rather than those of the organization. The restrictions are in place to ensure that donations are used for the expressed purpose of the nonprofits; violations can result in penalties, including revocation of the organization\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nonprofit status.\\nThe petition notes that Mr. Trump himself signed annual I.R.S. filings, under penalty of perjury, in which he attested that the foundation did not engage in political activity. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis statutory prohibition is absolute.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nYet after the Iowa fund-raiser, Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s foundation \\xe2\\x80\\x9cceded control over the charitable funds it raised to senior Trump campaign staff, who dictated the manner in which the foundation would disburse those proceeds, directing the timing, amounts and recipients of the grants,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d according to the petition.\\nThat same month, an official at the foundation emailed Mr. Lewandowski, who was Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign manager at the time, telling him \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe should start thinking about how you want to distribute the funds collected.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMr. Lewandowski, in a reply, wrote that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think we should get the total collected and then put out a press release that we distributed the $$ to each of the groups.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He later sent a list of veterans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 groups \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpurportedly approved by Mr. Trump to receive grants from the Foundation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe list was created by another campaign staffer, Lisa Maciejowski Gambuzza, and edited by a third, Stuart Jolly, a political director. And Mr. Lewandowski asked that some of the disbursements be made in Iowa in the days before that state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presidential nominating caucuses, which mark the kickoff of the primary calendar.\\nAllowing the campaign to control the spending of the foundation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charitable funds represented coordination between the two entities, as well as \\xe2\\x80\\x9can improper in-kind contribution of no less than $2.823 million (the amount donated to the foundation) to the campaign,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d according to the lawsuit.\\nBeyond the restitution, the foundation and its directors could face several million dollars in additional penalties, depending on how the court rules. The attorney general\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office is also seeking to bar the president from serving as a director, officer or trustee of another nonprofit for 10 years.\\nLikewise, the petition seeks to bar Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s three eldest children, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric, from the boards of nonprofits based in New York or that operate in New York for one year, which would have the effect of barring them from a wide range of groups based in other states.\\nWhile the three eldest children ostensibly served on the foundation board from 2006 to 2017, the board never even met after 1999, according to the petition, which called the foundation \\xe2\\x80\\x9can empty shell that functions with no oversight by its board of directors.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe action could force Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s children to curtail relationships with a variety of organizations. Last year, for example, Ms. Trump said she created a charitable fund, the Ivanka M. Trump Charitable Fund, to receive the unpaid portion of her book advance and any future royalties. In her government ethics report disclosed on Monday, she said she donated $289,300 to the fund. However, no publicly filed reports are available for that group yet.\\nAfter the election, Eric Trump distanced himself from his charitable foundation, which has also been under investigation by the attorney general\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office related to shifting its resources to the Trump Organization.\\nMr. Trump long feuded with Ms. Underwood\\xe2\\x80\\x99s predecessor, Eric Schneiderman, who resigned last month amid a scandal involving allegations that he had physically abused a number of his girlfriends. Weeks after the 2016 election, Mr. Schneiderman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office issued a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnotice of violation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to the foundation, which had already attracted scrutiny over its practices, and ordered it to immediately stop soliciting charitable donations in the state.\\nAmanda Miller, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, released a statement from the Trump Foundation on Thursday that characterized the lawsuit as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpolitics at its very worst.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The statement accused Mr. Schneiderman of using the foundation investigation \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto not only advance his own political goals, but also for his own political fund-raising,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and suggested that Ms. Underwood has shown that \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuch political attacks will continue unabated.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMr. Schneiderman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s resignation had raised questions whether his office, which had been at the heart of the Democratic legal resistance against the Trump administration, would persist in such efforts.\\nBy filing the lawsuit, Ms. Underwood, who is a career prosecutor rather than a politician, seems inclined to do so.\\nShe also recently accused Mr. Trump of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cundermining the rule of law\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with his pardon practices. She made the comment when she announced she was continuing an effort begun under Mr. Schneiderman to change New York\\xe2\\x80\\x99s double-jeopardy law so that state and local prosecutors would have the power to bring criminal charges against aides to Mr. Trump who have been pardoned.\\nThe Trump Foundation has been in legal limbo since after the election, when the president wanted to dissolve it amid growing controversy about its practices. But in late 2016, a spokeswoman for the attorney general\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office, Amy Spitalnick, said the foundation \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccannot legally dissolve\\xe2\\x80\\x9d while it is under investigation.\\nThe attorney general\\xe2\\x80\\x99s referrals to the I.R.S. and the F.E.C. could add another wrinkle that might slow the foundation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dissolution. The agencies are not known for their expeditious handling of enforcement actions, and the lawsuit notes that the foundation cannot legally complete its wind down \\xe2\\x80\\x9cuntil the complaints to the Internal Revenue Service and Federal Election Commission have been resolved and it is determined if any penalties or fines will be imposed on the foundation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d' target:-1\n",

Here are the obstacles ahead this year:\\nThe big challenge: Changing the narrative\\nAfter three solid months of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbotched rollout\\xe2\\x80\\x9d stories, Democrats will have to hope that the reality of new health coverage for millions of Americans will be enough to outweigh the disruption the law is causing to millions of others.\\n( Also on POLITICO: Barack Obama's albatross: Transparency)\\nEven now, top Democrats are convinced that, at some time during the year, there will be a natural tipping point. Enough people will either have coverage through the law or know someone who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s benefiting from it, they say, that Democrats will be able to put Republicans on the defensive about wanting to take their benefits away.\\nJoel Benenson, Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pollster, is already playing down the threat of any lasting damage from the rollout. He insists that most Americans \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwant leaders in Washington taking actions that will strengthen their economic security and keep growing jobs and our economy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a signal that the administration still believes the Affordable Care Act can be part of a broader economic security message.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe only people obsessed with the ACA rollout today are Washington insiders,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Benenson said in an email, noting that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe have had a presidential campaign and a year in Congress where those who advocated for repeal of Obamacare lost.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nOther Democrats are quicker to acknowledge that the past few months have hurt the Obamacare cause. But they still believe the politics will turn around when more people have health coverage who could never get it before, especially people with serious health problems.\\n( Also on POLITICO: HHS offers help for people who miss Obamacare deadline)\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe hard reality is that, particularly in October, the vast majority of people who tried to sign up had a terrible experience,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Democratic Rep. Rob Andrews of New Jersey. And \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif I had one thing to do over again,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, it would have been to give the people with substandard individual health plans a warning that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have to upgrade \\xe2\\x80\\x94 saying, in effect, that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou can still buy a car without seat belts and airbags, but that day is going to change.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut over the course of 2014, Andrews said, it will be clear to most Americans that the law doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t touch them \\xe2\\x80\\x94 so Republicans who keep attacking it as a fundamental threat to their health care will have \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca Chicken Little problem.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nRepublican pollsters aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t so sure about that.

      "features:b'John Kasich will end his bid for the presidency Wednesday afternoon in Columbus, according to multiple reports. Kasich had planned to hold a press conference at Dulles Aiport near Washington Wednesday morning, but he never took off\\xe2\\x80\\x94perhaps an apt metaphor\\xe2\\x80\\x94staying home and scheduling a press conference for 5 p.m., where he is expected to make his announcement.\\nThe Ohio governor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exit leaves Donald Trump as the last man standing in the Republican field. Though he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d already assumed the mantle of presumptive nominee with Senator Ted Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exit Tuesday night\\xe2\\x80\\x94after Trump trounced both of them in the Indiana primary\\xe2\\x80\\x94Kasich\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exit seals the deal. Kasich has been mentioned for weeks as a potential vice-presidential candidate for Trump, who will need to shore up his policy and political credentials ahead of the general election.\\nWhile hardly anyone predicted Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s success in the Republican campaign, few expected Kasich would get this far either. In a crowd of young, charismatic GOP figures, Kasich was the odd man out, a somewhat more grizzled figure who had run abortively for president in 2000, and a comparatively moderate figure in a party trending increasingly to the right. Somehow, Kasich managed to hold on to the bitter end, the final challenger to Trump.\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not to say that his campaign was especially successful. Many observers felt Kasich was pursuing a replay of former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failed 2012 bid for the Republican nomination. Huntsman and Kasich even shared a campaign architect, the heterodox GOP strategist John Weaver. The playbook may have gotten Kasich farther than it did Huntsman, but that still wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t enough to win the nomination, or even to come close. (As for Huntsman, he now backs Trump.)\\nFor a time, before Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ascendancy became inevitable, Kasich\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan seemed plausible. In New Hampshire, the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first primary and second nominating contest, he placed (a distant) second to Trump, and hoped to portray himself as the reasonable alternative to the entertainer. But having placed a huge bet on the Granite State, Kasich had little infrastructure in place for the rest of the campaign, and was a non-entity in the South Carolina primary. By the time the campaign reached his home state, Kasich was effectively out of the running. Ohio turned out to be the only state that he won. He closes out the campaign with fewer delegates than Senator Marco Rubio, who dropped out on March 15.\\nKasich\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sell to voters was that amid a sea of volatile, unpredictable characters like Trump and wild-eyed radicals like Cruz, he was an old-style true conservative who could also win swing states like Ohio. To the extent that his campaign had a policy theme, it was his advocacy for a balanced-budget amendment\\xe2\\x80\\x94a vague promise, tethered to his work on balancing the national budget while in the U.S. House in the 1990s. (Opinions about just how central Kasich had been in that work differed widely.)\\nBut some of his other policy stances were at odds with much of the Republican Party. As governor, he had circumvented the GOP-led Ohio legislature to accept Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. As though that were not bad enough, he compounded his offense in the eyes of conservatives by justifying his choice by faith. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, when you die and get to the meeting with St. Peter, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut he is going to ask you what you did for the poor. You better have a good answer.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMany of Kasich\\xe2\\x80\\x99s former colleagues viewed his image as a soft, cuddly, friendly politician with skepticism\\xe2\\x80\\x94they remembered a more irritable, angry Kasich\\xe2\\x80\\x94it seemed to take with many voters. The problem was that Republican primary voters didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want a sane, rational nominee in 2016. They wanted a Trump.\\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

(REUTERS)\\nHouse Republican leaders said Wednesday they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done their job in negotiations to solve the looming fiscal crisis, while President Obama is returning to the campaign trail to sell tax hikes that studies show won&apost have much, if any, effect on solving the problem.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have done our part by putting revenue on the table,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.\\nCantor and fellow House leaders have agreed to close tax loopholes to generate revenue to reduce the $1.1 trillion annual deficit. But they argue the president has yet to say publicly what cuts he will make to the federal budget -- specifically to costly entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security -- to reduce the deficit.\\nThey also say the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan to extend tax cuts only to middle-class Americans will not generate enough revenue to significantly reduce the deficit.\\nThe leaders made their argument the same day Gene Sperling, director of the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s National Economic Council, told House Democrats that failing to extend Bush-era tax cuts to the top 2 percent of income earners could trickle down to hit the middle class, sources tell Fox News.\\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the president ramped up his public pitch amid a backdrop of hand-picked, middle-class voters at the White House.\\n\"Right now, as we speak, Congress can pass a law that would prevent a tax hike on the first $250,000 of everybody&aposs income,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \"And that means that 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small businesses wouldn&apost see their income taxes go up by a single dime.\"\\nHe also urged Americans to use social media to try to persuade their congressional representatives to take the deal \\xe2\\x80\\x93 telling them to use Facebook and their Twitter accounts. Obama even announced a new White House hashtag My2K -- a reference to the estimated $2,200 tax increase that a typical middle-class family of four would see if the Bush tax cuts expire.\\nThe president met later in the day with top U.S. business leaders to discuss his strategy and is scheduled Friday to host a rally in the Philadelphia area to again tout his plan.\\nAmong the chief executive officers who were scheduled to attend the event were Muhtar Kent of Coca-Cola, Home Depot&aposs Frank Blake and Brian Roberts of Comcast.\\nTexas Sen. John Cornyn on Wednesday joined the chorus of Republican leaders appealing to the president to instead get engaged in negotiations, saying he has no public plan for cuts while continuing to criticize Republicans for demanding a tax-cut extension for all Americans.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll that Republicans are asking is to maintain the current rates until we adopt real bipartisan tax reform,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cornyn said in an editorial Wednesday in the Dallas Morning News.\\nHowever, later in the day, it was announced that two of Obama&aposs chief negotiators will meet Thursday with congressional leaders to gauge prospects for a deal.\\nTreasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and White House legislative chief Rob Nabors will meet separately with House Majority Leader John Boehner, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California.\\nThe White House and Congress are trying to reach a deal before Jan. 1 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 when all of the Bush-era tax cuts are set to expire and huge reductions to the federal budget kick in automatically. Those spending cuts are part of a default agreement by Congress after it failed reach a more measured deal to reduce the roughly $1.3 trillion annual deficits that have brought the national debt to more than $16 trillion.\\nThe mix of tax increases and budget cuts will equal roughly $100 billion alone next year and about $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years should Congress and the White House fail to reach a deal. Some economists say that could plunge the economy into a recession.\\nCantor was joined at a Capitol Hill press conference by House Majority Leader John Boehner, Majority Whip Rep. Kevin McCarthy and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, incoming chairwoman of the House Republican Conference.\\nCantor also said he was pleased to see that senior Obama adviser David Plouffe note that Medicare and Medicaid are drivers of the deficit.\\nPelosi at a separate Capitol Hill press conference furthered the Democrats argument that the party has already made cuts.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have already agreed to over a trillion dollars in cuts,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The California congresswoman said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe&aposre looking to see what the revenue piece will be to that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe first cracks appeared to be developing among Republicans over whether to accept Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deal.\\n\"If we don&apost believe taxes should go up on anybody, why can&apost we accept a deal that takes 98 percent out and still leaves us free to fight on the other grounds,\" said Oklahoma Republican Rep. Tom Cole, a confidant of Boehner.\\nStill, Cole&aposs comments drew a rebuke from Boehner, who is standing firm against Obama&aposs demand that tax rates go up for top earners.\\n\"He&aposs a wonderful friend of mine and a great supporter of mine, but raising taxes on the so-called top 2 percent -- half of those taxpayers are small business owners,\" Boehner said. \"You&aposre not going to grow the economy if you raise the top two rates.\"\\nErskine Bowles, a former Clinton chief of staff who has been active in trying to help reach a deal, said if negotiators fail to reach a deal the country is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgoing to go over the cliff.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I think everybody realizes that would be disaster.

      "features:b'\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The death toll in the protests on Monday, in which Israeli forces opened fire on Palestinian demonstrators, reached 60 overnight and one person was reported killed on Tuesday.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The center of Gaza City was calm after the militant group Hamas, which rules the territory, called for a general strike.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The number of protesters was a fraction of what it had been the day before as Hamas scaled down the demonstrations but held out the threat of military action.\\nImages of an 8-month-old Palestinian girl who died during protests at the Israel-Gaza border fence circulated widely on social media on Tuesday, fueling outrage over a lethal Israeli response that left at least 58 dead and thousands wounded.\\nBut the day after the baby, Layla Ghandour, died on Monday, the details of her death were challenged by some, becoming another example of how the competing narratives surrounding the conflict and the power of images have influenced debate.\\nThe child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s family said she died from inhaling tear gas fired by Israeli forces during the protests. She was with her family nearby as the Israeli military sought to keep back thousands of Palestinian protesters storming the fence.\\nOn Tuesday, Avichay Adraee, an Arabic-language spokesman for the Israeli military, posted a message on Twitter that said there was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfundamental doubt about the credibility\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of that account.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have several testimonies questioning the authenticity of this statement,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he tweeted without providing additional details. The Associated Press cited an unnamed Gaza-based doctor as saying on Tuesday that the baby had a pre-existing medical condition and that he did not believe her death was caused by the tear gas.\\nHer story is a reminder of the power of images, particularly those of children caught up in conflict. In Syria, the face of 5-year-old Omran Daqneesh covered in dust and blood became a symbol of Aleppo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suffering. As tens of thousands of refugees flooded Europe, the photos of the lifeless body of 3-year-old Aylan Kurdi washing up on Turkey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coast prompted both outrage and action.\\nIn the latest chapter, photos of the parents clutching the lifeless body of the baby girl in Gaza spread on social media, and her story became a rallying cry for those denouncing Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crackdown on Palestinian protesters.\\nThe child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s parents have given interviews to journalists and aid workers in Gaza recounting how their daughter died. A tweet from Steve Sosebee, who works with the Palestine Children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Relief Fund, suggested that they confirmed their daughter had an underlying health condition.\\nHamas dialed back the protests on Tuesday, and the mosque loudspeakers that had urged Gazans to protest on Monday were largely silent. In Gaza City, the biggest protest area on Monday, only a few hundred protesters came close to the border fence.\\nShortly before sunset, the Hamas leader Ismail Haniya appeared and was thronged with supporters.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want peaceful protests, we want rockets fired,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they chanted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRevenge, Revenge!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMr. Haniya smiled and clenched his fists in the air, but was vague about the group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s next step.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Great Return protests and the raids on the border by our youth are proof that we have confused the enemy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe will continue with the protests, and it is the Palestinian people who will decide the situation on the ground.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSpeaking separately, his nephew, Muhammad Haniya, also a Hamas leader, said Hamas was satisfied with the surge of international sympathy for Gazans the protests elicited. But he warned that Hamas could easily return to violence if that sympathy did not convert into an easing of the 11-year-old Israeli blockade of the territory.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe cannot be patient for much longer after all these deaths,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf the world does not intervene, I do not think that Hamas can remain silent, and our armed resistance will respond.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nFor now, he said, the protests would continue every Friday.\\nAs of Tuesday evening, Hamas had not taken military action. And there were signs behind the scenes that Hamas could be looking for a way to bring a halt to the bloodshed, if not the entire protest campaign.\\nOne well-informed Middle Eastern government official, who insisted on anonymity, said Hamas officials had been surprised by the number of casualties on Monday, but did not wish for the kind of escalation of hostilities that some Gazans were demanding in response. Hamas had failed in its goal of infiltrating Israel and harming or kidnapping an Israeli, the official said, but might be willing to settle for having revived international interest in the Palestinian cause. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Declan Walsh and David M. Halbfinger\\nGaza awoke on Tuesday to a grim agenda: funerals for protesters killed along the fence bordering Israel, including one for an 8-month-old baby girl whose family said she was overcome by tear gas; and frenzied work treating the thousands of wounded, in hospitals so overrun with patients that tents were set up in their courtyards.\\nThere was also uncertainty about whether the demonstrations would grow, fade, or give way to an outright armed conflict. The death toll in the protests reached 60 overnight.\\nThe demonstrations on Monday, the latest in a series intended to spotlight anger on the blockade that has inflicted economic misery on the residents of Gaza, coincided with the formal relocation of the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, another source of grievance for Palestinians.\\nA day after the protests, Palestinians commemorated the Nakba, the expulsion or flight of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes upon the creation of the state of Israel 70 years ago. Large protests in Gaza and in the West Bank had been planned, but in the wake of Monday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bloodshed, a more subdued approach appeared to have taken hold.\\nIn downtown Gaza City, the streets were quiet, largely because Hamas, the militant group that controls the territory, had ordered a general strike. Shops were closed, though the streets were not entirely deserted because people were streaming to mosques for midday funerals of those killed on Monday. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Isabel Kershner and Declan Walsh\\nEarly in the demonstrations, which began on March 30, organizers had called for a climax on Tuesday, but by late afternoon, only small protests had materialized along the border, in sharp contrast to the vast crowds there on Monday.\\nAt the biggest protest area, east of Gaza City, the gathering numbered in the hundreds, rather than the thousands. Only a few dozen people ventured close to the border fence, including young men with slingshots and a group of eight women chanting slogans.\\nProtesters had rolled tires toward the fence, and sent a few burning kites across the barrier. Twice on Tuesday afternoon, an Israeli drone flew over the demonstrators and dropped tear gas canisters.\\nNasser Ghurab, 51, was shot dead on Tuesday near the border, said Ashraf al-Qidra, a spokesman for the Gaza Health Ministry. He said that the Israeli military has killed 109 Palestinians in Gaza in nearly seven weeks of protests, and wounded thousands, many of them with live ammunition.\\nOn the Israeli side of the fence, a field was set alight, apparently by one of the Palestinian kites. But for the most part, a tense, almost pastoral calm prevailed.\\nAt a protest site between the cities of Beit Hanoun and Jabaliya, in the northern part of Gaza, no protesters could be seen at midday. Across the fence, Israeli emergency firefighting teams sat idle. The only trace of the previous day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s events on the Israeli side were scorched patches of ground where kites had set wheat fields on fire.\\nSoldiers and other onlookers were left to wonder whether some kind of a deal had been struck overnight: After all, they noted, the Kerem Shalom crossing from Israel into Gaza, a main point to transport goods into the territory that had been damaged three times by protesters, was abruptly reopened just days after Israeli officials said it had been almost destroyed.\\nIsraeli Palestinians planned demonstrations for Tuesday evening in Umm el-Fahm, Majd el-Krum and in the Negev, and marches were expected in the cities of Haifa, Nazareth, Tel Aviv and a handful of smaller places. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Iyad Abuheweila, Isabel Kershner, Declan Walsh and Ibrahim El-Mughraby.\\nThe Israeli Defense Forces said in a statement that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cat least 24 terrorists with documented terrorism backgrounds were killed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on Monday.\\nThe military said that most of the 24 were \\xe2\\x80\\x9cactive operatives\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of Hamas, while some were affiliated with another group, Islamic Jihad. The military also said that it had thwarted an attempt by three Hamas cells to cross the fence into Israel under cover of the chaos, but it did not say whether it had killed any of them.\\nThe Israeli military also did say not what, if anything, it knew about the affiliations or history of the majority of the Palestinians killed.\\nThe statement illustrated the radically different language used by the two sides. What Palestinians called peaceful demonstrations, the Israeli military described as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cviolent riots,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and it referred to those who gathered as \\xe2\\x80\\x9crioters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d People the Israeli authorities call militants and terrorists, Hamas calls martyrs. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Isabel Kershner\\nUnited Nations human rights officials said on Tuesday that Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use of lethal force against Palestinian demonstrators was unjustified and called for an independent investigation into what could be grave breaches of international law.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe condemn the appalling deadly violence in Gaza yesterday,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rupert Colville, spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra\\xe2\\x80\\x99ad al-Hussein, told reporters. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are extremely worried about what may happen later today,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe urge maximum restraint. Enough is enough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nInternational law allowed for the use of lethal force only as a last resort in the face of an immediate threat to life or serious injury, Mr. Colville noted.

      "features:b'On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell formally decided to call off a health care vote that he and other senior Republicans had been pushing toward for weeks.\\nStraddling a mere two-seat majority in the chamber, McConnell had to beat a hasty retreat after a number of his members indicated that they would not support the Senate\\'s version of the Obamacare repeal bill, officially called the Better Care Reconciliation Act. The cancellation paralleled an earlier move in March by the House GOP leader Paul Ryan to scuttle a vote doomed to fail.\\nOne person who saw all this coming was former House Speaker John Boehner. Out of Congress since the end of 2015 following a conservative attack on his leadership, Boehner told a high-dollar health care industry conference in February of this year that there was no way that Republicans were going to be able to \\xe2\\x80\\x9crepeal and replace\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Affordable Care Act.\\n\"In the 25 years that I served in the United States Congress, Republicans never, ever, one time agreed on what a health care proposal should look like. Not once,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Boehner told attendees, according to a report by Politico\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Darius Tahir.\\nBoehner continued, recounting that he had advised his former colleagues not to waste their time with bills that would merely repeal Obamacare without implementing some sort of alternative system.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll this happy talk that went on in November and December and January about repeal, repeal, repeal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Boehner said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you pass repeal without replace you\\'ll never pass replace, because they will never, ever agree on what the bill should be. Perfect always becomes the enemy of the good.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nInstead of repealing Obamacare, Boehner argued, Republicans should make smaller tweaks around its edges, eliminating some of the most unpopular aspects.\\nIn that scenario, the former GOP leader said, Republicans would basically \"fix the flaws [of the existing law] and put a more conservative box around it.\"\\nBoehner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s predictive record has been better than Nostradamus since then. And the reason is simple: Republicans are bad at health care. McConnell, one of the Senate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s savviest operators in a generation, seems to have been aware of this. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why, in 2014, he essentially said that making smaller changes to the Affordable Care Act was his preference. At a Tuesday evening news conference, McConnell signaled to his caucus that he would reach a bipartisan deal with Democrats if Republicans couldn\\'t get to agreement.\\nBeyond the wide policy differences between his members that have always made McConnell\\'s job difficult, the GOP\\'s health care proposal is extraordinarily unpopular. The House\\xe2\\x80\\x99s version of the bill had a 16 percent approval rating in a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll. According to Chris Warsaw, a MIT assistant professor of political science, the bill is even more disliked than the original version of health care reform that spooked Democrats in 1993.\\nAs currently written, either chamber\\'s bill almost certainly will endanger the party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s senators in purple states. Normally, politicians are loathe to stick their necks out for proposals that are unpopular, even if they agree with them. So why bother?\\nObviously, political ideology is playing a huge part. Conservatives have long wanted to slash the federal budget or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdrown it in the bathtub,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the infamous words of Americans for Tax Reform\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Grover Norquist. Unified GOP control of the Congress and presidency is a great opportunity in that regard.\\nBut ideology alone doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t explain why Republicans are promoting a piece of legislation that is literally the most unpopular bill in the recent history of opinion polling.\\nThe first reason the GOP is pushing for such an unpopular piece of legislation is what might be called the conservative establishment. This loosely connected network of activists and talk show hosts has been whipped into a frenzy for seven years about the horrors of Obamacare. Failing to give them some sizable piece of legislation that they could call \"repeal\" will engender media attacks and primary challenges.\\nParty officials are also worried that if Republicans can\\'t manage to achieve some sort of repeal, this will turn off many reliably conservative voters in the upcoming 2018 midterm elections. That matters because, thanks to President Donald Trump, the Democratic base is highly energized. If Republicans can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get their own team to show up for the vote, they could face heavy losses.\\nThe second pressure on the GOP is its donors. At a conference last week sponsored by billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch, several of the Republican Party\\'s largest benefactors flat-out threatened to close the money spigot unless Republicans in Washington pass major legislation on health care and taxes.\\nA third reason why congressional Republicans might pass a bill that could well endanger their own re-election prospects is their sheer ignorance of political reality. According to a 2013 academic paper, GOP elected officials think their constituents are much more conservative than they really are. In fact, according to the study, nearly half of all the Republican politicians surveyed believed their voters were more conservative than those found in the furthest-right political districts in the country.\\nA final reason why Republicans are sure to press forward with some kind of health care bill, after they lick their wounds and return from the July 4 recess, is that most of the spending cuts in the Senate and House bills will affect people on Medicaid. The Senate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bill, for example, reduces the program\\xe2\\x80\\x99s budget by $772 billion. In the GOP mythos, most of the individuals on Medicaid are poor people in big cities who are likely to vote for Democrats. Lowering Medicaid payments, in the minds of these Republicans, is merely taking money away from lazy slackers who don\\'t deserve public assistance.\\nWhite House adviser Kellyanne Conway perfectly illustrated this attitude in a Monday morning interview on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFox & Friends,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d suggesting that the only people on Medicaid are people who choose not to work.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMedicaid is intended for the poor, the needy and the sick,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo if you have an able-bodied American who again is not poor, sick, needy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not talking about the elderly who benefit, the children, the pregnant women, the disabled \\xe2\\x80\\x94 if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re able-bodied and you would like to go find employment and have employer-sponsored benefits, then you should be able to do that, and maybe you belong, as [Health and Human Services] Secretary [Tom] Price has made clear, in other places.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAs was true in the case about how conservative the typical voter is, however, reality is different from Republican perception. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 59 percent of adults on Medicaid have jobs. About 80 percent are part of a working family. Many of the remainder of people on Medicaid are people who cannot work, such as individuals in retirement homes.\\nEven worse for the GOP is that many Medicaid recipients are Republican voters.\\nCombined with Republicans\\' ideological urge to cut government spending, these four factors explain why the GOP is going down a path that can only be described as suicidal. In 2010 the right widely mocked then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for claiming that Americans would grow to like the Affordable Care Act once it was passed. As it turns out, she was correct. The inverse is likely to happen with the Better Care Reconciliation Act, assuming it ever is passed by Congress. But because conservatives have such a distorted view of political reality, they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see the train coming.\\nIn the end, McConnell may opt to take a short-term hit from the right\\'s outrage machine rather than risk his Senate majority. But there are plenty of reasons he might not be able to.' target:-1\n",

The submarine had been launched in 1966, and was part of the Navy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nuclear fleet until its decommissioning in 1993.\\nMachinist Mate First Class Monica Helms was nervous about going to the reunion. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99d served on the Francis Scott Key as well as on another sub for eight years. But she\\xe2\\x80\\x99d come out as transgender since that time. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t clear how her shipmates would react.\\nShe needn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have worried. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was an amazing experience,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she told me. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe were just shipmates, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all it was.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Thirty years later, there was still a sense of loyalty, not only to the country, but to the people with whom she had served.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe fact that we were all doing the same work, experiencing the same stress, going through the same problems, that put you on the same level as them. They see that you are willing to do the job, and you can do it, and they are fine with that. They trust you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nI spoke with Ms. Helms on Wednesday, about an hour after President Trump announced, in a series of tweets, that transgender people are not welcome in America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s military, reversing a movement toward open and unashamed service initiated during the Obama administration.\\nNo, thank you, President Trump. Thank you for making it clear, once again, that you were lying during the campaign when you tweeted to L.G.B.T. people: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nTransgender Americans have served and are serving courageously in our military. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI came from a long line of people who have served in this country,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ms. Helms. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo have someone say to me, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not worthy to be allowed to serve, simply because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m different, is a horrible and bigoted way of looking at things.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe statement isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just horrible and bigoted. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also inaccurate. Trans medical costs to the military are not \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctremendous\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they are negligible.\\nA RAND study commissioned by the former defense secretary Ashton B. Carter found that transgender service members would \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccost little and have no significant impact on unit readiness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It estimated that paying for active-duty members to transition would cost $2.9 million to $4.2 million a year. The study also found that there are around 2,450 transgender active-duty service members (though other estimates go above 15,000). What will these people do now?\\nAnd as for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdisruption\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how some people in the last century viewed the military service of African-Americans.\\nIn fact, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctoday is the anniversary of President Truman fully integrating black Americans into the military,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Amanda Simpson, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense who also happens to be transgender, pointed out to me. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s abhorrent and disrespectful that President Trump would choose this anniversary to discriminate against our service members,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she continued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s picked on the most vulnerable people to create a distraction, but he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s picked on the wrong people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s picked on service members.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s armed forces reflect not only the kind of country that we are, but the one we wish to become. In speaking of the service of black American in World War II, Bill De Shields, a retired Army colonel, once said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe symbol of black participation at that time was \\xe2\\x80\\x98the Double V.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d That meant \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvictory against the enemy abroad, and victory against the enemy at home. The enemy at home of course being racism, discrimination, prejudice and Jim Crow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nFor trans people, the enemy at home is alive and well; just last week the Texas Legislature convened a special session in order to try to enshrine anti-trans bigotry into law. Discrimination is a threat not just to trans Americans but to all of us who live in a country in which one group of people is told that they do not belong.\\nAs a co-chair of Glaad, I spent Wednesday morning hearing from dozens of vets struggling with the sense that the country they served does not value their lives.\\nVandy Beth Glenn, a former Naval officer, said she joined the Navy \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto serve and protect the nation and the system of government that stood for so many ideals I cherished: freedom, equality, a guarantee of various rights.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She continued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe Donald Trump feels anything but contempt for transgender Americans \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or any human beings beyond his immediate family.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMore and more transgender service members have begun coming out before retiring.

      "features:b'Whew.\\nAfter 48 days of living with helicopters, heavily armed police officers, the rumors and constant questions -- where is he? -- the people of northeast Pennsylvania can finally relax.\\nThe manhunt for Eric Matthew Frein, accused of killing a Pennsylvania state trooper, is over. Heavily armed U.S. marshals captured Frein on Thursday night and turned him over to state police, who slapped the slain officer\\'s cuffs on him, put him in the back of the trooper\\'s squad car and sent him back to the barracks where the ambush occurred.\\n\"We just thought it was fitting,\" State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said.\\nFrein, 31, is charged with first-degree murder and other charges in a September 12 ambush outside the state police barracks in Blooming Grove.\\nHe\\'s accused of killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson and wounding Trooper Alex T. Douglass before melting into the thick Pennsylvania woods.\\nAuthorities had worried the survivalist and military buff with a reported history of cop hatred might go out in a violent standoff. In the end, he gave up without a fight.\\nHis capture ended a lengthy search that burned through some $10 million, according to the county prosecutor, and likely as many nerves.\\n\"It actually felt like I was in a war zone a couple of weeks ago, and it was hard to sleep for a few nights, worrying about where he is,\" resident Mark Denny told CNN affiliate WNEP-TV.\\nThe capture\\nThe squad of 13 U.S. marshals -- armed like a military special operations squad -- found Frein at an abandoned airport near Tannersville, authorities said.\\nFrein hadn\\'t been spotted. He was discovered as part of a \"routine sweep through the woods,\" State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens told reporters.\\nAnd he wasn\\'t armed at the time of his capture, according to police, much to the relief of authorities who feared a violent showdown.\\nWhen marshals surprised him in a field near the airport, he obeyed their orders to get down on his hands and knees and told them who he was, Noonan said. There was no struggle, Pike County District Attorney Raymond Tonkin said.\\nInvestigators searching the area did find a cache that included a sniper rifle, Noonan said. The rifle appears to be consistent with casings gathered during the investigation, he said.\\nFrein was in good physical condition when he was captured, apart from a cut on his nose that he had before the marshals found him, according to Noonan. He looked \"healthier than I would have expected,\" Noonan said.\\n\"He\\'s been stashing food, he\\'s been staying out in the woods,\" Noonan said. \"He had a lot of locations he knew how to hide in. And also, he had been preparing himself by participating in these re-enactments, especially in the Vietnam era, where he specifically trained himself and trained with other people to hide in the woods and avoid detection.\"\\nOfficials said they were unsure how long he had been hiding at the airport.\\nOpinion: Were cops out of line in trooper-killing arrest?\\nCourt appearance\\nDuring his court appearance Friday Frein looked thin, with the cut on his nose and abrasions on his forehead. His left cheek was swollen.\\nHis voice was strong as he answered, \"Yes I do,\" to a Pike County judge\\'s question if he understood the charges against him, which include first-degree murder and criminal homicide of a law enforcement officer.\\nAbout 30 police were in the room for the 10-minute hearing.\\nTonkin, the district attorney, said he plans to seek the death penalty.\\nFrein is being held in the Pike County Correctional Institute in Lords Valley. In an interview with CNN on Friday, Gov. Tom Corbett said he expects authorities to make sure Frein stays safe.\\n\"I\\'m sure they will have all precautions taken, not only for his well-being from other inmates but from himself, too,\" Corbett said.\\nMotive unclear\\nTonkin declined to say what, if anything, Frein has revealed about the attack that left Dickson dead and Douglass critically wounded.\\nDouglass has since been released and is continuing to recover, according to police.\\nAfter his arrest, Frein made statements implicating himself in the shootings, according to a law enforcement official who was briefed on the capture. Authorities also found his diary, but contents of that document haven\\'t been revealed.\\nAuthorities have not discussed a motive but have said Frein has talked and written about hating law enforcement.\\n\"I\\'ve characterized his actions in the past as pure evil, and I would stand by that,\" Tonkin said Friday.\\nA review of his computer hard drive shows he had planned an attack for years, authorities said.\\nAccording to the criminal complaint against him, Frein searched the Internet going back to 2012 for information related on placing supply caches, police manhunt techniques and how to evade them and other topics.\\n\"Eric Frein had a mission that was to attack law enforcement,\" Noonan said. \"If he got out of those woods, we were very concerned that he would then kill other law enforcement. And if not them, civilians. That\\'s why we had to keep the pressure on.\"\\nThere was no indication that anyone was helping Frein, who was \"quite well-prepared,\" Noonan said.\\n\\'A celebration\\'\\nFrein\\'s arrest punctured the thick tension that had blanketed the region for weeks.\\n\"It\\'s been a long seven weeks,\" Corbett said on CNN\\'s \"New Day.\"\\nDuring the search, some outdoor activities were curtailed and some schoolchildren didn\\'t go out for recess.\\n\"It\\'s just exciting and we\\'re happy. We didn\\'t go out of school for weeks for recess,\" resident Shannon Juirad told WNEP.\\nAnd then there was the question of Halloween.\\nAt least one community, Barrett Township, canceled trick-or-treating as the search dragged on, instead suggesting children show up at a school parking lot to collect candy under the supervision of local and state police.\\nBut with Frein in custody, the trick-or-treating will go on as normal, said Barrett Township Board Chairman Ralph Megliola.\\n\"I\\'m ecstatic -- and just in time for Halloween!\" Megliola said.\\nPennsylvania Game Commission Executive Director R. Matthew Hough lifted the temporary prohibition on hunting and trapping activity in all areas that had been affected by the manhunt.\\nOutside the police barracks, residents held a sign reading, \"Way to Go PSP.\" Passing motorists slowed, also offering words of encouragement for the Pennsylvania State Police.\\n\"We all have children and we were afraid to go outside, we were afraid to do anything,\" one woman told CNN affiliate WBRE-TV.\\n\"I can\\'t even explain what I\\'m feeling right now, this is awesome. We are so proud of our Pennsylvania State Police, their hard work,\" another said.\\n\"Now it\\'s a celebration,\" one woman wearing a \"Barrett Proud\" shirt told WNEP.' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'Editors and reporters meeting in Chicago raised concerns Wednesday about what they described as a lack of access and transparency undermining journalists\\' work, several blaming the current White House for setting standards for secrecy that are spreading nationwide.\\nCriticism of President Barack Obama\\'s administration on the issue of openness in government came on the last day of a three-day joint convention of the American Society of News Editors, the Associated Press Media Editors and the Associated Press Photo Managers.\\n\"The White House push to limit access and reduce transparency has essentially served as the secrecy road map for all kinds of organizations \\xe2\\x80\\x94 from local and state governments to universities and even sporting events,\" Brian Carovillano, AP managing editor for U.S. news, said during a panel discussion.\\nJames Risen, a New York Times reporter who is facing potential jail time as he battles government efforts to force him to testify at the trial of a former CIA officer accused of leaking classified information, also spoke at the conference. Risen said intense pressure on reporters and their sources is having a chilling effect on newsgathering.\\nHe spoke of scaring one source just by going to his home and knocking on the front door.\\n\"He opened the door and he turned white,\" Risen said. \"He marches me back through the kitchen (to a back exit) and said, \"\\'Go out that way.\\'\"\\nRisen added that the government appeared to be taking advantage of how the media industry is off balance amid the growing influence of online news sources and financial hardships. He asked if the government would have taken such a hard line when traditional media were on firmer footing decades ago.\\n\"I kind of think the answer is no,\" he said. Media shouldn\\'t shrink before the challenge, Risen said, adding, \"The only response ... is to do even more aggressive investigative reporting.\"\\nThe AP\\'s Washington chief of bureau, Sally Buzbee, said the Obama administration\\'s efforts to control information extend even to agencies not directly involved in intelligence gathering. Some sources, she said, have reportedly been warned they could be fired for even talking to a reporter.\\n\"Day-to-day intimidation of sources is also extremely chilling,\" she said.\\nBuzbee said she\\'s frequently asked if the Obama administration, when it comes to transparency, is worse than the administration of President George W. Bush.\\n\"Bush was not fantastic,\" she said. She added, \"The (Obama) administration is significantly worse than previous administrations.\"\\nWhite House spokesman Eric Schultz said Obama is committed to transparency.\\n\"Over the past six years, federal agencies have gone to great efforts to make government more transparent and more accessible than ever, to provide people with information that they can use in their daily lives, and to solicit public participation in government decision-making and thus tap the expertise that resides outside of government,\" Schultz said in a emailed statement.\\nSome speakers Wednesday also broached questions of reporters\\' safety after recent beheadings of journalists by Islamic militants.\\nJohn Daniszewski, vice president and senior managing editor for international news at AP, said organizations that threaten reporters today have more chaotic chains of command. As a result, he said, militants might act on orders of an immediate commander rather than a government authority.\\n\"While danger is nothing new ... there has been a shift,\" he said.\\nSantiago Lyon, AP vice president and director of photography, added freelancers are also more prevalent in conflict zones. He said among the questions media groups must ask about freelancers they are considering relying on is, \"Are they bona fide journalists ... rather than just thrill seekers?\"' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'WASHINGTON \\xe2\\x80\\x94 The United States added new sanctions against Russia on Monday, expanding the list of targets but concentrating on the myriad holdings of four billionaires viewed as part of President Vladimir V. Putin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financial circle.\\nAccusing Russia of failing to live up to its agreement to defuse the crisis in Ukraine, the Obama administration took aim at 17 banks, energy companies, investment accounts and other firms controlled by the four men, in what amounted to an attempt to constrain the assets available to Mr. Putin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s close associates and perhaps to the president himself.\\nAlthough the measures do not explicitly target Mr. Putin, American officials indicated that the choice of targets was intended to send a message to him that any hidden assets he might have could ultimately be affected.\\nIn addition to the firms, the administration imposed sanctions on seven other prominent Russian figures, including two longtime Putin advisers: Igor I. Sechin, president of the state-owned Rosneft oil company, and Sergei V. Chemezov, the director general of Rostec, the Russian state corporation overseeing high-technology industries. The European Union said it would follow with sanctions on 15 Russians.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe goal here is not to go after Mr. Putin personally,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d President Obama told reporters in Manila, where he was wrapping up a weeklong trip to Asia. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe goal is to change his calculus\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto encourage him to actually walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to diplomatically resolving the crisis in Ukraine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe sanctions follow several previous rounds of punitive measures that to date have not noticeably changed Mr. Putin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s calculus, and American officials privately expected no different result in the short term.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect there to be an immediate change in Russian policy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one administration official, briefing reporters under ground rules in which he would not be identified. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat we need to do is to steadily show the Russians that there are going to be much more severe economic pain\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and isolation.\\nAdministration officials, including some in the more hawkish camp, said the new sanctions were a more serious effort than earlier rounds. Some said the \\xe2\\x80\\x9csecondary effects\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of chilling business with those targeted were becoming more significant, and they expressed optimism that the Europeans were more willing to talk about tougher measures after a team of European military observers was taken captive by pro-Russian forces in eastern Ukraine.\\nMr. Obama will host Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany at the White House later this week to coordinate whatever the next steps will be against Mr. Putin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s government. Ms. Merkel, whose country has extensive economic, cultural and historical ties to Russia, is seen as the linchpin of any coordinated effort, and Mr. Obama has made it his priority to maintain a united front with the Europeans against Russia.\\nCritics called the latest sanctions inadequate. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI expected more from these U.S. sanctions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Cliff Kupchan, a Russia analyst at the Eurasia Group, a firm that advises businesses. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo have a shot at changing Putin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s calculus, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to get serious on economic measures \\xe2\\x80\\x94 at least hit a large Russian bank. We missed the target today.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAnders Aslund, a Russia scholar at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the sanctions were \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca whimper\\xe2\\x80\\x9d after the tough talk by Mr. Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry.\\nBut he added that the intent was clearly to send a message to Mr. Putin about any hidden wealth. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is going after Putin personally, not the Russian economy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Aslund said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s telling him we know where you have your money. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to sanction you personally.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe actions will freeze any assets in the United States and bar Americans from doing business with the individuals and firms listed. The individuals will also be denied visas to enter the United States. Moreover, the United States will cut off the export or re-export of American-made products to 13 of the companies and deny export licenses for high-technology items that could contribute to Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s military capabilities.\\nThe 17 firms targeted were all tied to Russian businessmen who were targeted in previous rounds of sanctions. Eleven of the companies are linked to Gennady N. Timchenko, including the Stroytransgaz Group, the pipeline construction arm of Gazprom, and the Volga Group, his private investment holding company. Mr. Timchenko was a co-founder of the Gunvor Group, a commodities trading firm in which the Treasury Department has previously said Mr. Putin has personal investments. Gunvor has adamantly denied that Mr. Putin has any financial ties to the company, and Mr. Timchenko has sold his shares in Gunvor.\\nThree other firms targeted on Monday were tied to Arkady and Boris Rotenberg: InvestCapitalBank, SMP Bank and Stroygazmontazh. Three others were subsidiaries of Yuri V. Kovalchuk\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Bank Rossyia: Abros, Zest and Sobinbank. The Treasury Department has referred to Mr. Kovalchuk as the personal cashier for Mr. Putin.\\nOthers targeted Monday were Dmitri N. Kozak, a deputy prime minister; Vyacheslav V. Volodin, a deputy chief of staff to Mr. Putin; Aleksei Pushkov, chairman of the international affairs committee of the State Duma, the lower house of Parliament; Oleg Belavantsev, appointed by Mr. Putin last month as presidential envoy overseeing the annexed Crimean Peninsula; and Yevgeny Murov, director of Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Federal Protective Service.\\nAlthough administration officials said over the weekend that they also expected Aleksei B. Miller, the head of the energy giant Gazprom, to be targeted, he was not on Monday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s list, but he may be added later.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cToday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s targeted sanctions, taken in close coordination with the E.U., will increase the impact we have already begun to see on Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own economy as a result of Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actions in Ukraine and from U.S. and international sanctions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, said in a statement.\\nIn imposing sanctions on Mr. Sechin, the administration has targeted a top partner of Exxon Mobil, which has multiple joint ventures with Rosneft. It is not known if Mr. Sechin has any assets in the United States to freeze, but he will no longer be permitted into the country to consult with his Exxon Mobil partners. Exxon Mobil had no comment on Monday.\\nThat the sanctions covered no large publicly listed Russian companies came as a relief to traders in Moscow. Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s benchmark Micex index closed with a modest gain of 1.5 percent. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt looked to be on the light side\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of what the markets expected, said one banker in Moscow, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis was more of a reminder that a new phase of sanctions is possible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d' target:-1\n",

      "features:b'Millions of Americans visited new online health insurance exchanges as enrollment opened on Tuesday, suggesting a broad national appetite for the affordable coverage that President Obama has promised with his health care law. But many people quickly encountered technological problems that prevented them from getting rates, comparing health plans or signing up.\\nFederal and state officials said that while they knew there was pent-up demand for health coverage, the number of visits to their exchanges was greater than anticipated. Federal officials said more than 2.8 million people had visited HealthCare.gov, the federally run exchange that serves residents of more than 30 states, though the figure would include those who received error messages. State-run exchanges also reported higher-than-expected use, including several million visits to New York\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Web site.\\nThe demand \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexceeds anything that we had expected,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d President Obama said at the White House on Tuesday afternoon.\\nBut it remained unclear whether the array of problems \\xe2\\x80\\x94 many people received messages saying the system was down, and others were unable to create accounts to buy insurance \\xe2\\x80\\x94 stemmed more from heavy traffic or from flaws in design. Federal and state officials had promised for months that the exchanges would be ready for heavy use by Oct. 1, and had run numerous tests to ensure that the complex systems would work properly from the start.\\nThe problems came on a landmark day for the health care law, Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s signature legislative achievement and the central issue in the Congressional battle over federal spending that has led to a shutdown of the government. A trouble-plagued start, accompanied by the complaints of frustrated consumers, may undermine political support for the law and discourage people from signing up.\\nAcross the country, people trying to use the Internet exchanges expressed mixtures of hope and frustration.\\nAt the Jessie Trice Community Health Center in Miami, out of about 70 people who arrived seeking help with the new program before noon, no one was able to get access to the marketplace. All were given appointments to come back another week.\\nAt the Lower Light Christian Health Center, a clinic just west of downtown Columbus, Ohio, Carrie Moss, a certified application counselor, said the exchange Web site was not working when she tried to show patients their health care options.\\nAnd in Kentucky, by 9 a.m. the state-run insurance exchange was freezing up, with users unable to take even the first step of creating an account. Gwenda Bond, a spokeswoman, said that more than 1,000 applications had been filed online by 8:30 a.m., and that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9chigh volume of traffic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was to blame for the technical problems.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis surge of early applications demonstrates the pent-up demand for quality health coverage,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Bond said.\\nBy late afternoon in the East, state exchanges reported much heavier traffic than expected to their Web sites. New York said that 10 million attempts had been made to reach its site, although with many people making multiple tries, it was not clear how many individuals that represented. And officials said the figure was so far beyond anything they had considered plausible that they were investigating the cause.\\nIn Illinois, the exchange site had 70,000 visits from 65,000 people, with 1,100 applications submitted. Kentucky had nearly 78,000 unique visitors, who started nearly 4,700 applications and completed more than 2,900. Oregon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exchange had 75,000 visitors, but with the state still working out some problems, it has postponed the ability to apply for coverage.\\nAbout 55,000 people went to Colorado\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exchange site, and 1,450 created accounts to allow them to start shopping for plans. Idaho\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exchange had more than 8,000 visitors, but it was not clear whether any of them were able to apply, because the applications were routed through the federal system.\\nIn California, Peter Lee, the executive director of Covered California, said the state health exchange was running slowly because it had received five million hits on Tuesday, and he said workers were performing maintenance to speed it up. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome of the folks have had a slow experience,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Lee said at Union Station in Los Angeles. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSurprise, surprise.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nCritics quickly seized on the technology problems as evidence that the health care law was deeply flawed.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe should have never gotten to this point,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Obama administration should have acknowledged the ample warning signs of problems in the exchanges and heeded the many calls for delay.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut in his Rose Garden appearance, Mr. Obama staunchly defended the law, saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is life-or-death stuff.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTens of thousands of Americans die each year just because they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have health insurance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the president said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMillions more live with the fear that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go broke if they get sick. And today, we begin to free millions of our fellow Americans from that fear.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn all, the Obama administration expects about seven million people to be enrolled in private health plans through the exchanges in 2014. Millions more are expected to get coverage under an expansion of Medicaid, although many states are refusing to go along with the expansion because their leaders are opposed to the health care law.\\nFederal officials would not say how many people successfully enrolled in health plans on Tuesday through the federal site. They also conceded that factors beyond high use had contributed to the Internet delays.\\nThroughout the day, users had difficulty creating online accounts and therefore could not see their health plan options or premiums. Users were asked to provide answers to three \\xe2\\x80\\x9csecurity questions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but many could not choose or write in any security question.\\nIn a telephone conference call on Tuesday afternoon, Marilyn B.

But those systems also stumbled, dependent on the same glitch-plagued computer systems.\\nIn Louisville, Ky., dozens of people went to Jefferson Community and Technical College, where seven counselors were ready to help them sign up for coverage and find out if they were eligible for federal subsidies. But because of problems with the Kentucky exchange Web site, the counselors mostly had to abandon their laptops and hand out paper applications or ask people to come back another day.\\nWhen Christie Hartlage tried to start the online application process for Keairra Taylor, 23, a warning message popped up on her laptop screen: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn unknown error has occurred.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMs. Taylor, who works part time at a day-care center while she studies to become a social worker, said she had symptoms of multiple sclerosis and a growing pile of medical bills from frequent hospitalizations. Her 1-year-old son is covered by Medicaid, but Ms. Taylor said she currently did not qualify for the program, despite earning less than $7,200 a year.\\nIf Ms. Taylor qualifies for Medicaid under an expansion of the program that is taking place in Kentucky under the health care law, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt will feel like a weight has been lifted,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\nIn Columbus, Patrick Gamble, an employee of Columbus Neighborhood Health Centers who was helping people enroll, said he had similar frustrations with the federally run exchange on Tuesday.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Web site is log-jammed right now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEveryone is eager for information.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAsked what patients thought about the new exchange, Mr. Gamble added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNobody has gotten that far.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAlthough some people who tried to explore their options or enroll on Tuesday were frustrated, others said they did not mind waiting a little longer for the coverage, which will not take effect until Jan. 1.

      "features:b'Michael R. Bloomberg has instructed advisers to draw up plans for a potential independent campaign in this year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presidential race. His advisers and associates said he was galled by Donald J. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dominance of the Republican field, and troubled by Hillary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stumbles and the rise of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on the Democratic side.\\nMr. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, has in the past contemplated running for the White House on a third-party ticket, but always concluded he could not win. A confluence of unlikely events in the 2016 election, however, has given new impetus to his presidential aspirations.\\nMr. Bloomberg, 73, has already taken concrete steps toward a possible campaign, and has indicated to friends and allies that he would be willing to spend at least $1 billion of his fortune on it, according to people briefed on his deliberations who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss his plans. He has set a deadline for making a final decision in early March, the latest point at which advisers believe Mr. Bloomberg could enter the race and still qualify to appear as an independent candidate on the ballot in all 50 states.\\nHe has retained a consultant to help him explore getting his name on those ballots, and his aides have done a detailed study of past third-party bids. Mr. Bloomberg commissioned a poll in December to see how he might fare against Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, and he intends to conduct another round of polling after the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9 to gauge whether there is indeed an opening for him, according to two people familiar with his intentions.\\nHis aides have sketched out a version of a campaign plan that would have the former mayor, a low-key and cerebral personality, give a series of detailed policy speeches backed by an intense television advertising campaign. The ads would introduce him to voters around the country as a technocratic problem-solver and self-made businessman who understands the economy and who built a bipartisan administration in New York.\\nMr. Bloomberg would face daunting and perhaps insurmountable obstacles in a presidential campaign: No independent candidate has ever been elected to the White House, and Mr. Bloomberg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s close Wall Street ties and liberal social views, including his strong support for abortion rights and gun control, could repel voters on the left and right.\\nBut his possible candidacy also underscores the volatility of a presidential race that could be thrown into further turmoil by a wild-card candidate like Mr. Bloomberg.\\nIf Republicans were to nominate Mr. Trump or Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a hard-line conservative, and Democrats chose Mr. Sanders, Mr. Bloomberg \\xe2\\x80\\x94 who changed his party affiliation to independent in 2007 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 has told allies he would be likely to run.\\nEdward G. Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania and a past Democratic National Committee chairman, said he believed Mr. Bloomberg could compete in the race if activist candidates on the left and right prevailed in the party primaries.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMike Bloomberg for president rests on the not-impossible but somewhat unlikely circumstance of either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz versus Bernie Sanders,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Rendell, a close ally of Mrs. Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s who is also a friend of Mr. Bloomberg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf Hillary wins the nomination, Hillary is mainstream enough that Mike would have no chance, and Mike\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to go on a suicide mission.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn a three-way race featuring Mr. Sanders and Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Rendell said he might back the former New York mayor.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs a lifelong Democrat, as a former party chairman, it would be very hard for me to do that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I would certainly take a look at it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 absolutely.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMr. Bloomberg declined to comment on his interest in the 2016 race, and most of his associates would speak only on the condition that they not be named. Mr. Bloomberg is irked by the perception that he has toyed too often with running for national office, according to several associates, and is said to be wary of another public flirtation.\\nAt the same time, these associates said, he has grown more frustrated with what he sees a race gone haywire. A longtime critic of partisan primary elections, Mr. Bloomberg has lamented what he considers Mrs. Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lurch to the left in her contest against Mr. Sanders, especially her criticism of charter schools and other education reforms that he pushed as mayor and has continued to support since leaving office.\\nAt a dinner party late last fall at the home of Roger C. Altman, an investment banker and former deputy Treasury secretary, Mr. Bloomberg delivered a piquant assessment of Mrs. Clinton as a presidential candidate.\\nIn the presence of Mr. Altman, a longtime supporter of Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, Mr. Bloomberg described her as a flawed politician, shadowed by questions about her honesty and the continuing investigation into her email practices as secretary of state, according to two people in attendance.\\nThe outcome of that investigation, Mr. Bloomberg said, was anyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guess.\\nSetting a March deadline for making a decision allows Mr. Bloomberg to see how Mrs. Clinton and the more mainstream Republican candidates fare in the early primaries. And because of his vast wealth, there is no downside in laying the groundwork for a possible campaign, even if he ultimately decides against it.\\nEven a victory by Mrs. Clinton in the Democratic primaries might not preclude a bid by Mr. Bloomberg, his associates said, if he believed she had been gravely weakened by the contest.\\nMr. Bloomberg has maintained a constructive relationship with the Clintons over the years, working closely with Mrs. Clinton during her tenure in the Senate and at one point even suggesting that she run to succeed him as mayor.\\nOne adviser said that Mr. Bloomberg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s preparations reflected the unsettled state of the race, and the perception that Mrs. Clinton was flagging against Mr. Sanders.\\nMr. Bloomberg, this adviser said, believes voters want \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca nonideological, bipartisan, results-oriented vision\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that the early primary favorites have not presented.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t about Hillary Clinton,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the adviser said in an email. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe fact is Hillary Clinton is behind in Iowa and New Hampshire. That should scare a lot of people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and it does.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Public polls have shown Mr. Sanders leading in New Hampshire, a close race in Iowa and Mrs. Clinton with a solid lead nationally.)\\nMrs. Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign declined to comment on Mr. Bloomberg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interest in the race. But on a campaign conference call with supporters on Saturday, Jennifer Palmieri, a top Clinton aide, told allies that she believed Mr. Bloomberg would only run if Mr. Sanders won the nomination, and that the Clinton camp intended to foreclose that possibility.\\nSince the 2012 election, Mr. Bloomberg has repeatedly mused at private events about Mitt Romney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presidential campaign as a cautionary tale for candidates from the business world. Mr. Romney assembled an impressive record as a private equity investor before serving as governor of Massachusetts; the Obama campaign branded him as a heartless corporate raider.\\nSocial acquaintances and political and business leaders said they had been surprised to find their encouraging remarks about a possible 2016 campaign answered with intense seriousness by Mr. Bloomberg, who has stressed that he would run if he saw a path to victory.\\nMr. Bloomberg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brain trust has examined previous third-party efforts dating to Theodore Roosevelt in 1912, giving closest attention to the campaigns of John Anderson in 1980 and H. Ross Perot in 1992.\\nIt is unclear whether Mr. Bloomberg would be more likely to draw voters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 support from a Democrat, like Mr. Sanders or Mrs. Clinton, or a conservative Republican.\\nWhile Mr. Bloomberg supports many of the Democratic Party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s social policies, he has been a fierce defender of the financial services industry, which is unpopular with many liberals, and enacted aggressive policing policies in New York City that are anathema to left-leaning voters.\\nAnd when he first ran for mayor in 2001, he did so as a Republican. But he has also poured energy and money into advocating policies that conservative Republicans detest, most notably gun control and immigration reform.\\nMr. Bloomberg has seen Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign rhetoric on immigration as especially distasteful. But in an interview in Iowa on Saturday, Mr. Trump said he \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwould love the competition\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of having Mr. Bloomberg in the race, and alluded to their different business backgrounds and divergent policy views. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the opposite of me in many ways,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOpposite on guns, opposite on numerous issues.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nA spokesman for Mrs. Clinton declined to comment on Mr. Bloomberg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interest in the race and his comments about her campaign.\\nAlan Patricof, a financier and longtime donor to the Clintons who is also friendly with Mr. Bloomberg, said it would be \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca terrible thing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for the Democratic Party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prospects of winning the White House if the former mayor ran as an independent.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf it was President Trump or President Bloomberg, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d certainly rather have President Bloomberg,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Patricof said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut it certainly can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help the Democrats.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSome Republicans are less certain of the effect Mr. Bloomberg would have on the race. In swing states like Ohio and Virginia, suburban moderates who recoil from certain liberal policies might be more likely to support Mr. Bloomberg than a candidate like Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz.\\nRepresentative Daniel M. Donovan Jr., a New York Republican who is a friend and golfing partner of Mr. Bloomberg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, said that many voters \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwho aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t totally satisfied with any of the people who are running right now, would welcome a Mike Bloomberg candidacy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMr. Donovan said he could consider supporting Mr. Bloomberg, depending on how the rest of the race develops.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe governed more in pragmatic ways than in ideals,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Donovan said, adding, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat may be different from some of the folks, like Senator Cruz, who are apparently doing well among primary voters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d' target:-1\n",

      "features:b'The Supreme Court\\'s announcement that it would hear two cases challenging laws prohibiting same-sex marriage has reinvigorated one of the most hotly contentious social debates in American history, a debate that has been fueled by a dramatic change in attitudes.\\nWith some states taking significant steps towards legalizing gay marriage, the hearings come at a critical moment.\\nThis week in Washington State, hundreds of same-sex couples lined up to collect marriage licenses after Gov. Christine Gregoire announced the passing of a voter-approved law legalizing gay marriage.\\n\"For the past 20 years we\\'ve been saying just one more step. Just one more fight. Just one more law. But now we can stop saying \\'Just one more.\\' This is it. We are here. We did it,\" Gregoire told a group of Referendum 74 supporters during the law\\'s certification.\\nWashington is just the most recent of several states to pass legislation legalizing same-sex marriage, signifying a significant departure from previous thinking on the controversial subject.\\nREAD: Court to Take Up Same-Sex Marriage\\nA study by the Pew Research Center on changing attitudes on gay marriage showed that in 2001 57 percent of Americans opposed same-sex marriage, while 35 percent of Americans supported it.\\nThe same poll shows that today opinions have greatly shifted to reflect slightly more support for same-sex marriage than opposition -- with 48 percent of Americans in favor and 43 percent opposed.\\nIn fact, just two years ago, 48 percent of Americans opposed same-sex marriage while only 42 percent supported it -- indicating that opinions have changed dramatically in the last couple of years alone.\\nCheck Out Same-Sex Marriage Status in the U.S. State By State\\nIt\\'s hard to imagine that only 16 years ago, the fervent gay marriage debate led to the conception of the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as a union solely held between a man and a woman.\\nWhile debating the Defense of Marriage Act in September 1996, former Sen. Robert Byrd said: \"If same-sex marriage is accepted, then the announcement will be official: America will have said that children do not need a mother and a father. Two mothers or two fathers will be OK. It\\'ll be just as good. This would be a catastrophe.\"\\nEven a few short years ago a newly-elected President Obama did not support the legalization of gay marriage. It wasn\\'t until earlier this year, at the end of hiss first term and with the impending election in sight, that the president told ABC\\'s Robin Roberts the he\\'d \"been going through an evolution on this issue.\"\\nObama went on to attribute his shift in stance to the influence of his daughters.\\n\"You know, Malia and Sasha, they\\'ve got friends whose parents are same-sex couples. It wouldn\\'t dawn on them that somehow their friends\\' parents would be treated differently,\" he said. \"That\\'s the kind of thing that prompts -- a change in perspective.\"\\nObama isn\\'t the only one to experience an evolution in thinking on the matter of gay marriage.

      "features:b'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, who had been lauded by President Donald Trump for his aggressive efforts to roll back environmental regulations, resigned on Thursday under heavy fire for a series of ethics-related controversies.\\nPruitt was one of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most polarizing Cabinet members, slashing regulations on the energy and manufacturing industries, including a move to repeal President Barack Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s signature program to cut carbon emissions from power plants, dubbed the Clean Power Plan.\\nHe was also instrumental last year in lobbying Trump to withdraw the United States from the global 2015 Paris climate accord to combat global warming.\\nBut Pruitt lost favor with Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inner circle after a string of controversies including first-class travel at taxpayer expense, lavish spending on security, the installation of a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office and accusations that he used his position to receive favors, such as a discounted rental on a high-end condo from an energy lobbyist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wife.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe unrelenting attacks on me personally, my family, are unprecedented and have taken a sizable toll on all of us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pruitt said in his resignation letter.\\nTrump announced the resignation on Twitter and said EPA Deputy Administrator Andrew Wheeler, a former mining industry lobbyist, will become the regulatory agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s acting chief on Monday.

      "features:b'There is a growing bipartisan feeling that something has gone wrong in America. We may have been heading toward it for a long time before the 2016 race and paid no attention. But now America is in crisis. It can be seen in the headlines of opinion writers this week in The Washington Post. From the right, Robert Kagan says, \"There is something very wrong with Donald TrumpDonald John TrumpTrump calls for global warming to \\'come back\\' amid winter storm Meadows re-elected House Freedom Caucus chairman Schultz says he won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t respond to Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x98childish\\xe2\\x80\\x99 tweet MORE.\" On the left, Eugene Robinson asks, \"Is Donald Trump just plain crazy?\"\\nThat GOP nominee Donald Trump can be president of the U.S. this time next year is a very real possibility and it is the cause for this concern. A Trump presidency would not only change America forever, but would shake the world. Already Britain and the European Union are feeling the effects. But it may not be too late. The moving testimony of Ghazala Khan, whose son was killed in combat in Iraq, has turned the heart of every mother in America, especially those who have lost a son or daughter in combat. Fathers, too, and everyone. Trump could spiral out of control starting today as America responds to Ghazala Khan\\'s moving testimony.\\nIt may have opened a window by bringing home to us the tragic realities of warfare, and it might have presented an opportunity to change course. It is not too late. But it is almost too late. Only a radical shift in procedures can change the fate that now looms over America.\\nThings could change of their own accord if the Clinton couple is determined to have traded influence for cash when Democratic nominee Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonHillicon Valley: US files criminal charges against Huawei | Facebook unveils new plans to crack down on misinformation | Ocasio-Cortez hits tech giants over event with climate skeptics House Dems unveil initial GOP targets in 2020 The Hill\\'s 12:30 Report: Funding talks, round two | Trump says another shutdown \\'certainly\\' possible | Trump mocks Starbucks CEO over 2020 talk MORE was secretary of State.

But it would still be hard to get him off the ticket, even if he plummeted in the polling.\\nBut in the circumstances of a suddenly vulnerable Trump, there is the possibility that Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee in 2012, might work out something with the Libertarians, running with his old pal William Weld \\xe2\\x80\\x94 like Romney, also a former Republican governor of Massachusetts \\xe2\\x80\\x94 who is the Libertarian choice for vice president.\\nTogether, Romney and Weld could advance a version of Libertarianism to fit a wider audience.

Libertarianism then in the hands of Weld/Romney would in effect then be a well-needed \"reform\" approach to the old Republican party. It has been suggested. But it is not likely to happen.\\nThere is another approach more appropriate to crisis and it has precedent in recent history. A gathering of the most highly respected elders on the Republican Party \\xe2\\x80\\x94 those without interest in awards or elected office \\xe2\\x80\\x94 might form a committee and stage an intervention.\\nA similar \"intervention\" occurred in 2006, when the Iraq Study Group, chaired by former Rep.

The Iraq Study Group was facilitated by the United States Institute of Peace, which released the committee\\'s final report on Dec. 6, 2006.\\nThe case might be made that the crisis we face today is even greater than that which we faced in 2006. Some might be called on again to form a similar ad hoc \"council of elders\" to change the pending fate that beckons here in 2016. Such an esteemed committee might bring together an ad hoc intramural party movement to operate within the existing Republican Party sphere \\xe2\\x80\\x94 potentially to save the Republican Party from oblivion in the hands of a renegade \\xe2\\x80\\x94 much as one changed the course of history in the Iraq Study Group.\\nThe committee might propose its own \"alternative\" candidates to face off against Trump on a one-time basis, stating clearly its governing principles. My choice for such independent \"alt\" candidates \\xe2\\x80\\x94 although the Trump party is really the \"alternative\" party now \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for president and vice president would be Romney and Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, for Romney has the best chance of winning and has spoken clearly about Trump, and Sandoval represents the best of America in a younger generation as the center of political gravity in America heads West.\\nGoing alone as an independent, Romney or another candidate would probably have little chance. But if he had the backing of a group of highly respected elders brought together specific to challenge a Republican party suddenly turned renegade, he might find success just as the Iraq Study Group did in 2006.\\nQuigley is a prize-winning writer who has worked more than 35 years as a book and magazine editor, political commentator and reviewer.

      "features:b'She is a gracious warrior with a kind face, a polished demeanor and the inner mettle of a survivor. Ann Romney has been called the secret weapon of her husband\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign, and he adores her: When Mitt Romney strides to the podium to introduce his wife of 43 years, he calls her \\xe2\\x80\\x9csweetheart.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She smiles. The crowd goes crazy.\\nAnd why shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they? Though the Romneys could emerge as the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s No. 1 power couple, there is a certain authenticity about them, built over decades around family and faith. She is confidante and counsel, trustworthy stalwart and humanizing companion \\xe2\\x80\\x94 ready to step before a global audience on Tuesday evening at the Republican National Convention and tell the world what she knows about her husband: He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good man, a smart man. And he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ready to be president.\\nMuch is riding on her speech, which has won cheerful accolades from Mr. Romney himself.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI spent a Monday morning with the Romneys at their summer home in New Hampshire. It is quickly apparent how close a partnership they have, and how much he relies on her,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fox News Sunday anchorman Chris Wallace, who recently strolled the shores of sparkling Lake Winnipesaukee with the couple, talking politics over a pancake breakfast.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe governor said she advises him on everything \\xe2\\x80\\x94 from strategy to staff to policy. He said she has \\xe2\\x80\\x98great instincts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 about how something will appear to different groups of people across the country. And he values her input,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Wallace said.\\nThe members of the extended Romney clan are close. They can be raucous. But it is Mrs. Romney who understands that politics at its best can be a true calling. She herself calls it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdestiny\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and is convinced that her husband can save America.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Romneys had a family meeting a couple of years ago about whether he should run again for president. It was the governor and Mrs. Romney, their five sons, and the five daughters-in-law. The vote was 10-2 against running,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Wallace recalled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe two in favor were Mrs. Romney and their oldest son, Tagg. She said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to run. The country needs you, especially with the economy in such trouble.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 She persuaded him to make another race for president.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe concept of a Romney White House already has journalists speculating about the style and substance of a couple who are traditional, determined and driven by a sense of obligation to creed and country. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also some unkind coverage percolating about the couple, and little promise of a media honeymoon should the Republican win the election. But a USAToday/Gallup poll released Monday finds that a mere 24 percent of the respondents had an unfavorable impression of Mrs. Romney, on par, the research said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwith other potential first ladies about to make their first convention appearances.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIt would appear that, like her husband, Mrs. Romney is ready for the role.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI spent some time with Mrs. Romney on the campaign bus in Iowa and was thoroughly impressed. She is truly a wonderful woman with an inspiring personal story. Like Mrs. Obama, I have no doubt she would be a wonderful first lady,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said CNN anchorman Wolf Blitzer.\\nThe evolving wife\\nMrs. Romney has earned her stripes as a political spouse.\\nConsider that in 2008, an eager Mitt Romney threw his hat into the big ring, only to yank it back after a few weeks when he lost to Sen. John McCain in the New Hampshire primary. His wife vowed never to venture on the campaign trail again after that. But some part of her was not done with it. She looked heavenward for guidance, she mulled over the practical possibilities. Mrs. Romney embraced a second run for the White House with zeal, driven, friends have suggested, by her own prayers, and by the intimate belief in her husband\\xe2\\x80\\x99s acumen as a businessman and his ability to return the nation to its true bearings.\\nShe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ready to rumble.\\nMrs. Romney has publicly acknowledged that she is at the convention to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunzip Mitt,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to act in the role of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMittigator\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who brings out the greater dimensions of her candidate husband. The Romney campaign sees her as a major asset on the podium, and she has reached a certain hallmark of public importance. Mrs. Romney now has Secret Service protection as well.\\nMrs. Romney will be showcased Tuesday evening, charged with warming up her husband\\xe2\\x80\\x99s image and appealing to a particularly powerful voting bloc in this election.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnn Romney has earned rock-star status this year among conservative women,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Teri Cristophe, co-chairwoman of She-PAC, a political action committee seeking to help elect conservative women running for federal and statewide office.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe is out on the campaign trail every day meeting women from all walks of life and has come to the same conclusion as many of us: The real \\xe2\\x80\\x98war on women\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is the economy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Christophe said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suspect that, like me, many women voters are extremely grateful to Mrs. Romney for speaking up about the economic hardships we are facing and the tough choices we are having to make in order to provide for our families. She is not at all intimidated by her critics and is clearly Team Romney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s greatest asset.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe Romney romance is still very much intact, their marriage traditional. The couple met in a Michigan elementary school, kept in touch, admired from afar and married in 1969. The bride was 19, the groom 22; their wedding portraits reveal a good-looking couple who eventually raised a family of five boys with ample home cooking, good cheer and Bible reading.\\nThe mother of five and grandmother of 18 is candid about the catastrophic illnesses that have upended her life, a struggle that has brought her much respect among voters. She is first to offer details about the challenge posed by her diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, and her husband\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attentive devotion during the worst of it.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEven when I was as sick as that, he would curl up in the bed with me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Romney recalled during a recent CNN interview. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was like he was going to do anything he could to just say, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m here. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re OK. Just stay right there, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be OK.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe incurable neurological disorder has been in remission, but not completely. Weakness sent her tumbling to the ground on Super Tuesday; it was a disturbing reality check, and a reminder to guard her health. Mrs. Romney also does not hide her encounter with breast cancer just as her husband\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign was getting under way in 2008.\\nPolitical prowess emerges\\nShe is tough in other ways, adamant, for example, in dismissing the Democratic Party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s demand for greater disclosure of the Romney tax records. Mrs. Romney also remains unapologetic about her role as a stay-at-home mom, an issue wrenched into the public discourse after Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen took issue with it in April, suggesting on CNN that Mrs. Romney didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand real women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s problems because she had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnever worked a day in her life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The liberal press instantly and gleefully ran with the story.\\nSo did Mrs. Romney. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI made a choice to stay home and raise five boys. Believe me, it was hard work,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said in her very first tweet shortly thereafter. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll moms are entitled to choose their path.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe moment perfectly illustrates Mrs. Romney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s political finesse, delivering her response with firmness and simplicity but no vitriol. Ms. Rosen publicly apologized for her remark, and the exchange prompted keen interest from broadcast news. Mrs. Romney, in fact, garnered twice as much coverage as first lady Michelle Obama that month, according to a University of Minnesota analysis released in the aftermath.\\nShe was born Ann Lois Davies in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., daughter of a Welsh-born self-made businessman who was also mayor of the pleasant town just 20 miles northwest of Detroit. Her husband\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father, George Romney, was governor of Michigan, ran for president in 1968 and was ultimately appointed secretary of housing and urban development by President Nixon. Her mother-in-law, Lenore Romney, ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 1970. House Minority Leader Gerald R. Ford attended her wedding to young Mitt. Ann Romney ran for town council representative in her residence at the time: Belmont, Mass. She was 27, campaigning door to door with printed handouts she made herself.\\nMrs. Romney won.\\nShe gained much additional insight about political realities after her husband tried unsuccessfully to unseat Sen. Edward M. Kennedy in 1994. Mr. Romney later declared that he would never run for office again unless he could win. The story changed eight years later when he was elected governor of Massachusetts by a generous margin.\\nIt will change again should he win the presidency.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI like my speech,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Romney told reporters Monday in anticipation of the Republican convention. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI really like Ann\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nCopyright \\xc2\\xa9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

A deserter with blood on his heels will walk free, leaving dead and maimed Americans in his wake, because of a bully\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pulpit and a weak man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bench and gavel. The miscarriage results from a president who tweets too much and a judge who discerns too little.\\nCandidate Trump tweeted some harsh things about the consequences he believed deserter Bowe Bergdahl should face. Among other things, Trump called Bergdahl a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdirty rotten traitor\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno good traitor who should have been executed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nCommentators expressed concern at the time about inappropriate command influence prejudicing military proceedings. Military commanders are not supposed to twist subordinate arms about military justice, not even the Commander in Chief. But, candidates are not commanders. Yet.\\nStill, based on Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s angry blasts, Bergdahl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lawyers sought a pardon or commutation from President Obama. They also sought a dismissal or other leniency from authorities presiding over the court martial. They were turned away in both instances. The presiding judge announced that he had not been influenced by Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s public outbursts. In any event, Trump had no command authority when he tweeted. The case continued.\\nAfter Bergdahl pled guilty, however, reporters challenged Trump about his pre-election tweets, asking if he had fatally tainted the prosecution. As National Review\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Legal Analyst and former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy points out, the only reasonable response for the seated Commander in Chief to offer is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo comment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump needlessly volunteered to the effect: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople heard what I said.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nCARTOONS | AF Branco\\nView Cartoon\\nCommentators again tutted that Trump was renewing his previous efforts at interference by publicly endorsing his prior thinking. But this time, he did it as president and Commander in Chief. Therefore, he put unlawful pressure on the military and its court martial system. The New York Times reported that the JAG Corps judge was willing to take the bait:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will consider the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s comments as mitigation evidence as I arrive at an appropriate sentence,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the judge, Col. Jeffery R. Nance of the Army, said during a hearing at Fort Bragg.\\'\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nToday Col. Nance sentenced Bergdahl to a minor fine and a dishonorable discharge. The ruling allows the man who wrote anti-American screeds, who left his post and cost valiant Americans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 their lives and health to walk free on America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s streets. No word yet on his possible book and movie deals.\\nNance\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement is an illogical disgrace and Bergdahl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sentence is a travesty.\\nNothing in law or logic makes the president\\'s intemperate outbursts or his subsequent mention of them \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmitigation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for the crimes of Bergdahl. They are external noise that should have no bearing on the proceeding or Nance\\xe2\\x80\\x99s judgment. They provide no information to suggest Berdahl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s betrayal is less treacherous to his nation or less dangerous for his comrades. They do not shed light on Bergdahl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mental or physical health, or provide any basis to excuse his actions.\\nThe president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ill-advised words don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mitigate in favor of Berdahl. They weigh against continuing the case. They run the risk of tainting the prosecution by undue influence. The case then, should either be deemed compromised and dismissed, or the statements excluded and ignored, and justice administered by the book. They provide no factual, legal, or moral justification to alter a just sentence in Bergdahl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s favor.\\nThis is especially true in a case where the relevant decision maker is a judge and not a jury. Federal rules of evidence allow the exclusion of evidence that may be more prejudicial than relevant or probative. But the concern is primarily about improperly influencing lay jurors. Col. Nance is not an impressionable member of a jury who needs to be protected from sensational headlines. He is a sworn and trained officer and jurist. His appropriate comment should have been: \"I will disregard the president\\'s irrelevant and inadmissible commentary. \"\\nHe should not have said, and then acted, on the suggestion that he would actually use the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s comments as a thumb on the scale to benefit the defendant.\\nRecommended\\nSo, Is This What Bernie Sanders Did On His 1988 \\'Honeymoon\\' To The USSR?\\nMatt Vespa\\nNance might have meant his ruling as a defiant middle finger aimed at President Trump (which, itself would indicate he was not influenced by unlawful pressure). But, the ruling did not produce a gesture at the president. It was much bigger. It fully, offensively spoke to the men and women who serve and sacrifice, their families, and millions of informed Americans who bear witness.\\nMay God please comfort the families and rest the souls of the men who died searching to find and rescue the deserter. And may Karma please visit Barack Obama and Susan Rice in their thoughts and dreams and torment them for the lies they knowingly told the nation about former Private Bergdahl.' target:1\n",
      "features:b'INDIANOLA, Iowa \\xe2\\x80\\x94 It was a preview of coming distractions.\\nWhen Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton decided to return to the state where her presidential ambitions first came undone six years ago, the idea was that they would remind Democratic activists about the importance of the midterm elections and honor their host, Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, who is retiring from Congress and held his final steak fry fund-raiser here Sunday. And that was what transpired, in part, on a sun-splashed day on a balloon field here, just south of Des Moines.\\nBut as is often the case wherever Mr. Clinton goes, what amounted to the unofficial start of the next Iowa presidential caucuses was as much about the Clinton who already served as president as the one who appears to have designs on the office.\\nThe 37th Harkin Steak Fry began with an impromptu 15-minute question-and-answer session between Mr. Clinton and a few dozen reporters at what is traditionally only a brief photo-op with the V.I.P.s and the beef on the grill.\\nIt concluded with a 30-minute tour d\\xe2\\x80\\x99horizon from the former president on topics including Haiti, his soon-to-arrive grandchild, Senator Mitch McConnell and the impact of the billionaires the Koch brothers on American politics. In between, Mr. Harkin; his wife, Ruth; and Mrs. Clinton herself did their best to focus attention on the other half of the once and perhaps future first couple.\\nIn a speech that was her most overtly political since she left the State Department last year, Mrs. Clinton repeatedly hinted at her intentions. She laced her remarks with all manner of pregnant references to the state that kicks off the presidential nominating process and veiled asides about her plans.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHello, Iowa, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m back!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed upon taking the microphone, stretching out the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cback\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as she smiled in front of hay bales, an American flag and a John Deere tractor.\\nSpeaking to about 10,000 Democrats \\xe2\\x80\\x94 many of whom wore stickers distributed by Ready for Hillary, an outside group that aims to build grass-roots enthusiasm for a potential Clinton candidacy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the former first lady all but winked and raised her eyebrows.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, teasing the crowd. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am thinking about it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn motivating the audience to vote in November, Mrs. Clinton said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cToo many people only get excited about presidential campaigns.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nShe added, after waiting a beat: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook, I get excited about presidential campaigns, too.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Just to make sure the crowd had not missed her point, she concluded her first speech in Iowa since 2008 by saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not let another seven years go by.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nOn Sunday, Mrs. Clinton repeatedly said she was glad to be back in Iowa, but the state holds bitter memories for her.\\nIn the 2008 Democratic caucus, Mrs. Clinton came in third behind then-Senator Barack Obama and John Edwards, a former senator from North Carolina. Her top campaign aides went on to criticize Iowa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s caucus as undemocratic and unimportant in selecting presidents, and she had not been back since the late-night results came in on Jan. 3, 2008.\\nMrs. Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first presidential campaign started here, with schmoozing at Mr. Harkin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s steak fry. At the event in 2007, the Clinton campaign, once seen as inevitable, saw firsthand the grass-roots support Mr. Obama had garnered in the crucial early voting state.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt really does feel like just yesterday when I was here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Clinton told the crowd. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs I recall, there was a young senator from Illinois there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMrs. Clinton has devoted much of her time since leaving her post as President Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s secretary of state to paid speeches and discussion of foreign policy to promote her memoir \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHard Choices.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But on Sunday, she jumped aggressively back into domestic politics with a populist message that praised the president, but also acknowledged that much work needed to be done to stem the tide of rising inequality.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe can build a growing economy of shared prosperity,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Clinton said.\\nHer speech also touched on women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economic and reproductive rights \\xe2\\x80\\x94 hot-button issues in midterm elections that could be determined by female voters.\\nThe Harkins sought to make it clear that, while the Clintons were co-headliners, it was Mrs. Clinton who was to be the focal point. Mr. Harkin made sure to note that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere are many more chapters to be written in the amazing life of Hillary Clinton.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Yet for all the effort to shine a rhetorical light on Mrs. Clinton, it was Mr. Clinton who seemed most happy to be back on the grand stage of presidential politics. As the Clintons and Mr. Harkin stood a few feet away from the sizzling beef, Mr. Clinton initially sought to deflect attention.\\nAsked how he was feeling, Mr. Clinton, his arm around Mrs. Clinton, replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs long as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still married to her, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m good.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAfter indulging a few questions, Mrs. Clinton drifted away, and the grill-side session soon became the Tom and Bill Show. Mostly it was the latter.\\nIt was a vintage bit of Clinton garrulousness, and the former president had little appetite to cut it short, despite the increasingly urgent pleas from aides behind him and Mr. Harkin. Mr. Clinton showered praise on Mr. Harkin, who is retiring after 40 years in Congress and a failed presidential run (cut short by an up-and-coming Arkansas governor by the name of Clinton).\\nBut as has been the case throughout his political career, once Mr. Clinton got going, there was no stopping him.\\nMrs. Clinton was long gone by the time her husband was dishing out some of his favorite lines (the Founding Fathers were pragmatists, and the Constitution could be called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Make a Deal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), praising the Ready for Hillary crew (he compared them to the Energizer Bunny) and assessing midterm campaigns from Iowa to Arkansas.\\nAbout the only topic Mr. Clinton did not broach was the one that drew many attendees and nearly all of the 200-plus credentialed reporters.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will not be baited,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said with a knowing grin when he was asked whether Mrs. Clinton would or would not disappoint all those activists working for Ready for Hillary.\\nThe event planners originally wanted Mrs. Clinton to follow her husband, but protocol dictated that he speak last.\\nThe former president recounted at some length his relationship and brief rivalry with Mr. Harkin.\\nAdditionally, Mr. Clinton used his remarks to decry dysfunction in Washington, and Republicans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 inability to strike compromise.\\nHe also lit into the billionaire conservative Kochs, who he said were \\xe2\\x80\\x9crunning black-bag operations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in this year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign.\\nAfter the speeches, Mrs. Clinton shook hands, signed copies of her book and posed for selfies with supporters.

      "features:b'A host of Republicans is calling for the head of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius over the troubled health care website rollout. Thirty-three Republican members of Congress signed Rep. John Fleming\\'s letter to President Barack Obama demanding that Sebelius be fired. But whether to sack her is not one of the questions we should be asking.\\nThe secretary spent 3 \\xc2\\xbd hours testifying before a congressional committee on Wednesday about the awful mess that was the launch of the federal website intended to allow millions of Americans to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\\nPunctuated by moments of contrition and obvious frustration, her performance was intended both to signal resolve to the American people that getting the website fully operational was her principal priority and to shield the president from the slings and arrows of the many critics of Obamacare, who gleefully saw this as an opportunity to embarrass him and re-energize their efforts to derail the law.\\nThe news Wednesday was replete with stories of Obama\\'s sagging popularity, and one can\\'t help but tie this drop, at least in part, to the problems with the rollout.\\nSo what is he, as our nation\\'s chief executive, to do? Should he heed those calls to demonstrate forceful leadership in a time of seriously flawed performance and fire Sebelius? After all, the argument goes, something like this would not be tolerated in the business world. The consequences would be swift -- the person responsible for the mess would be fired. And didn\\'t she admit in her testimony that she was responsible?\\nYes, she did. But here\\'s why the question of whether she should be fired is not the right one.\\nObama needs to keep his eye on the big picture. The issue is not Sebelius\\' future, it\\'s what needs to be done to fix the mess. She has accepted responsibility and has specified a time frame within which she has said the dysfunction will be repaired. Obama should support the secretary fully in her efforts. It is much more important for the President in the long run to make sure that people can sign up for insurance coverage under the ACA than to finger a scapegoat and orchestrate a public beheading.\\nThe difference between forceful leadership and nuanced leadership is significant, and the context and circumstances should determine which -- or what blend of the two -- is appropriate. Whatever momentary boost a \"forceful\" action might give the president in the polls would not justify the potential long-term consequences of firing a Cabinet member who arguably has served well in turbulent times.\\nObama said Wednesday that he would take ultimate responsibility, acknowledging that the buck stops at his desk. Two very tough questions, however, lie ahead: First, what should he do about Sebelius if the mess isn\\'t a whole lot less messy by the end of November? And second, what about his own political capital?\\nLet\\'s reserve judgment on the first one until the end of November comes around. At this point, my guess is that if implementation of the website hasn\\'t improved very much, Sebelius will resign.\\nRegarding the second, it\\'s clear that Obama has a lot riding on getting the system to work \"well enough.\" It might not happen by the end of November, but it will happen.\\nIt\\'s not yet clear where the problem with rolling out the health care website really lies.  Why such a shambles? Early indications point in two directions: diffuse authority (no one was really in charge of the whole initiative) and poor execution (the contractors simply dropped the ball). As we learn more about how the website was designed and tested, we will be in a better position to figure out what went wrong and where. But for the time being, we don\\'t know -- so why drop the guillotine blade and run the risk of beheading the wrong person?\\nThe problem is real, and so are the politics. Precisely because the ACA is so important to the President, its detractors see a golden opportunity to inflict possibly serious damage on its future. This is political hardball on steroids, and the grandstanding that we see in front of the cameras helps us understand -- as if we didn\\'t already -- why 74% of Americans polled are unhappy with the behavior of Congress. Calls to fire the secretary are intended to put Obama in the position of seeming weak if he does not. So he needs to respond in a way that is seen as decisive yet supportive of the secretary.\\nThe rearview mirror on the health information exchange mess isn\\'t quite in focus yet, because we\\'re still in the middle of it. But it\\'s true that little changes tend to have small ripple effects, and big changes, like the health care act, have huge ripple effects. And no change, little or big, is ever without a glitch.\\nLife in Washington is a circus. There are many rings with different events going on in each, and all are vying for the audience\\'s attention. If the circus is to continue, the most important job is to know where the tent poles are and guard them zealously.

Thomas MacArthur, New Jersey Republican, would shift to the states the burden of deciding what services insurers must cover and would let insurers charge healthy customers less, so long as states set up risk pools to subsidize sicker people priced out of the market.\\nNo state could waive the part of the Affordable Care Act requiring insurers to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions, however, preserving the most popular part of the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\\nSEE ALSO: HHS Secretary Price says there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a \\xe2\\x80\\x98plan B\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for Obamacare reform\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis amendment will make coverage of pre-existing conditions sacrosanct for all Americans and ensures essential health benefits remains the federal standard,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. MacArthur, chairman of the moderate Tuesday Group, said on his Facebook page Thursday after Politico published a one-page description of his plan.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unclear whether the proposal can win over enough holdouts to pass. Republicans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 first go-around last month ended in a mess after leaders were unable to muster the votes and had to yank the bill.\\nA Republican aide said lawmakers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even have legislative text of the proposal so they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know whether it can bridge the gap.\\nSEE ALSO: Brat: New health care bill can be done in a week\\nYet President Trump was bullish about their progress, saying House Republicans could revive their plan and hold a vote either next week or shortly thereafter.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe plan gets better and better and better, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gotten really good,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump said at a joint press conference with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni.\\nHouse Republicans are under immense pressure from the White House to deliver an Obamacare repeal, a campaign vow that hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been fulfilled as Mr. Trump nears 100 days on the job.\\nFailing a second time would be a gut punch for the party as it tries prove it can wield all the levers of political power successfully. After health care, Mr. Trump wants to tackle tax reform and a $1 trillion infrastructure plan.\\nHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, signaled on Wednesday that negotiators were putting the finishing touches on a plan to bridge rifts within the party over health care, although lawmakers also must focus on a stopgap spending bill to keep the government funded when it returns from its two-week break.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want to get both,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get both.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nUnder the MacArthur plan, states could ask Health and Human Services Secretary Thomas Price to waive Obamacare\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cessential health benefits\\xe2\\x80\\x9d package, which requires insurers to cover a slate of services such as mental health and maternity care.\\nThey also could scrap community rating, in which insurers are required to charge the same prices to everyone in a given area. Insurers wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be allowed to discriminate based on gender or age, though older people still could be charged up to five times more than young people.\\nStates could allow insurers to charge sicker consumers more than healthy ones, so long as they set up a \\xe2\\x80\\x9chigh risk pool\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to absorb some of their costs.\\nThat could win over hard-line House Freedom Caucus members, though it may scare off centrists who don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to tweak the guarantees of Obamacare.\\nWhile sicker customers could still get covered, they might face high premiums, health care analysts said.\\nThe analysts said legislative details will be crucial, including who would be in the high-risk pool and how much they would have to pay to get covered.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaybe this is enough to convince the Freedom Caucus people that states can do what they want to do, but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see this as being very popular,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University in Virginia who closely tracks the debate. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt would make coverage unaffordable for many older consumers and would segregate high-cost consumers in coverage that would likely be inadequate unless the high-risk pools were very generously funded.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nDemocrats accused Republicans of making a bad bill worse.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo make the bill more palatable to right-wingers, the big change appears to be the abandonment of the protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Yet another Trump promise shattered,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sen. Christopher Murphy, Connecticut Democrat. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Republican health care repeal bill was an unworkable, unpopular piece of garbage a month ago, and it still is today.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe published plan doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t provide much detail on the state waiver process, though it suggests waivers would be easy to obtain.\\nThe HHS secretary is supposed to approve the plan within 90 days of determining it is complete, although states \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmust attest that the purpose of their requested waiver is to reduce premium costs, increase the number of persons with health care coverage or advance another benefit to the public interest in the state, including the guarantee of coverage for persons with pre-existing medical conditions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nCopyright \\xc2\\xa9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

Authorities counter that Brown had attacked the officer in his car and tried to take his gun.\\nAfter a vigil for the teen devolved into chaos Sunday when violence and looting broke out among some protesters, NAACP President Cornell William Brooks called Monday for people protesting Brown\\'s death to do so nonviolently.\\n\"We have seen young people giving in to violence and frustration and rage. It may be inexcusable. It is not unexpected,\" Brooks told reporters. \"But I say to my young brothers and sisters, note the young man whose rage is your heart, note that he was nonviolent. He never got into a fight. If you want to honor his memory, honor his memory by seeking justice nonviolently.\"\\nWitnesses to Brown\\'s shooting say he was unarmed and had his hands in the air when the police officer shot him.\\nAuthorities tell a different story. St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar says the officer tried to get out of his vehicle just before the shooting, but Brown pushed him back into his car.\\nBrown \"physically assaulted\" the officer, Belmar said, and the teen tried to get the officer\\'s weapon.\\nBrown was shot about 35 feet from the vehicle, the chief said, declining to provide more details. The officer\\'s name has not been released by authorities.\\n\"The genesis of this was a physical confrontation,\" Belmar said, adding that his department has been called in to conduct an independent investigation.\\nThe Ferguson Police Department said its cars are not equipped with dashboard cameras.\\nShell casings collected at the scene were from the officer\\'s weapon, Belmar said.\\nMonday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the shooting \"deserves a fulsome review\" by federal investigators.\\n\"At every step, we will work with the local investigators, who should be prepared to complete a thorough, fair investigation in their own right. I will continue to receive regular updates on this matter in the coming days,\" Holder said in a statement. \"Aggressively pursuing investigations such as this is critical for preserving trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.\"\\nMother: \\'No violence, just justice\\'\\nThe lawyer representing Brown\\'s parents called Monday for a swift investigation.\\n\"We want this investigation to be done fairly, and we make a demand to the Justice Department to come in and help restore trust and confidence in the process of equal justice. ...

This community is very distrustful,\" attorney Benjamin Crump told reporters, calling for witnesses to come forward.\\nBrown\\'s parents urged people to remain calm.\\n\"No violence, just justice,\" the teen\\'s mother, Lesley McSpadden, told reporters.\\nMcSpadden said her son recently graduated from high school and was supposed to start college Monday.\\n\"We can\\'t even celebrate,\" she said. \"We\\'ve got to plan a funeral.\"\\nStanding beside the teen\\'s family, Brooks said the NAACP is committed to determining what happened.\\n\"We are committed to this family, committed to seeking justice, committed to being a presence, day-in and day-out,\" he told reporters.\\nMayor calls for calm\\n\"Obviously, the events of last night are not indicative of who we are,\" Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said on CNN on Monday morning, adding that Sunday night\\'s chaos was \"not constructive\" and was only \"bringing down the community.\"\\nSt. Louis County Police said 32 people were arrested and shots were fired at police.\\nMonday, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch said charges had been filed against about 10 people in connection with burglaries of several businesses.\\n\"What occurred last night, the mob action, we know certainly is not representative of what\\'s going on and what the people in the neighborhood necessarily think,\" he said.\\nFlanked by several from the community Sunday, McSpadden was McSpadden was emotional as she shouted into a television reporter\\'s microphone.\\n\"You took my son away from me! You know how hard it was for me to get him to stay in school and graduate? You know how many black men graduate? Not many!\" she said. \"Because you bring them down to this type of level where they feel they don\\'t got nothing to live for anyway! (They feel) they gonna try to take me out anyway!\"\\nOthers who gathered shouted at police.\\n\"We will stay out here as long as you are!\" they screamed at officers.\\nMany of the officers appeared stoic, watching young men kneel before them and raise their hands up to symbolize surrender, but one officer can be heard on video yelling back, calling protesters \"animals.\"\\nSome in Ferguson are demanding that the name of the officer who shot the teenager be released.\\nMonday afternoon, Jackson -- the police chief -- said he plans to release the name in the next 24 hours. Authorities want to make sure the officer is in a safe location, he said.\\n\\'Lost control\\'\\n\"Last night, everything lost control,\" Knowles said Monday.\\nHe was asked about the officer who called protesters \"animals.\"\\n\"The officers did their best. They\\'re only human,\" Knowles responded, adding that not every police officer present was from the Ferguson department.\\nSunday\\'s gathering became more intense as some people broke windows at a store and began taking things from it. They threw rocks and bottles. Gunshots rang out.\\nAntonio French, an alderman in St. Louis, said a QuikTrip gas station was looted and an ATM dragged out.\\n\"This QuikTrip is where things started (Saturday) with this case, based on various accounts,\" French said.\\nThe slain teenager and a friend were \"accused of stealing gum from the store or some sort of cigarettes,\" the alderman said.\\n\"People have a lot of anger and are frustrated,\" French said. \"They don\\'t have recourse in the system, and it happens often in this country, and it has boiled over. I think people are angry and looking for a reason to let it out tonight.\"\\nKnowles said he wants to let the independent investigation into Brown\\'s death take its course. He plans to meet with Brown\\'s parents soon and will meet with clergy in Ferguson and African-American leadership in the town.\\nWhatever the investigation\\'s findings, \"we will deal with that,\" he said.\\nMultiple gunshots\\nAn autopsy will determine how many times Brown was shot. The medical examiner for St. Louis County, Mary Case, said Monday afternoon the autopsy is complete, but she would not give details and said St. Louis County police will release the information.\\nToxicology results on Brown\\'s body are pending.\\nOn the number of times Brown might have been shot, Belmar has said, \"It was more than just a couple.\"\\n\"We don\\'t know what happened, and there are lots of conflicting stories,\" Knowles said. \"Unfortunately, there will have to be some time taken to understand what happened. Hopefully, we will get to an understanding, and justice will be served.\"\\nThe officer who shot Brown is on paid administrative leave during the investigation and will be available to talk to county homicide detectives.\\nHe has been with the force for six years and will be required to undergo two psychological evaluations before returning to duty, Belmar said.\\nCrump, who also handled the case of Trayvon Martin in Florida, said Monday that Brown\\'s family is \"devastated\" and doesn\\'t believe that the teenager got into a physical confrontation with police.\\nMartin, 17, was killed in 2012 by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted last year of murder charges.\\nThe high-profile case sparked a heated nationwide discussion of race as well as debate over Florida\\'s \"stand your ground\" law.\\nMonday, Crump said Brown\\'s shooting once again highlights \"the senseless death of a young boy of color at the hands of people who are supposed to protect and serve them.\"\\n\"Their son was doing all the right things,\" Crump said. \"Graduating from high school, never been in trouble.

I realize that there are no words that can ever equal their loss. I know that there is nothing that I can ever say or do to ease their heartache,\" Obama said Thursday.\\nOfficials are conducting thorough independent investigation of the operation to ensure this type of incident is never repeated. Earnest said the Office of the Inspector General was conducting an investigation.\\nA senior administration official told CNN that the review began in January after the drone strike occurred, but said the review so far suggests the operation \"was by the book until we realized these people (the hostages) were in there.\"\\n\"The concern is not about anything other than this is a colossal tragedy,\" the official said. \"This doesn\\'t seem to be raising any process flags ...

It\\'s a horrible day. It\\'s a war on cops,\" Johnson responded. \"And the Obama administration is the Neville Chamberlain of this war. I think their continued appeasement at the federal level with the Department of Justice, their appeasement of violent criminals, their refusal to condemn movements like Black Lives Matter, actively calling for the death of police officers, that type of thing, all the while blaming police for the problems in this country has led directly to the climate that has made Dallas possible.\"\\nRep.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) laid the blame for the shooting squarely in the hands of the perpetrators, while also suggesting that Obama, along with other public officials, including himself, take a look in the mirror.\\n\"I think all of us in public life, the president included, should re-examine everything we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve said, everything we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done up to this point to see if in our public discourse we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve contributed in any way,\" Rubio told reporters in Washington, adding, \"I think all of us need to re-examine constantly in this country and whether it contributes to the nation moving forward or whether sometimes we\\'re unnecessarily pitting people against each other.

The motivation for the shootings was under investigation, the police said, although her social media postings included criticisms of YouTube.\\nZuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital received three patients: a man, 36, in critical condition; a woman, 32, in serious condition; and a woman, 27, in fair condition, a hospital spokesman, Brent Andrew, said at a news conference. A fourth person had injuries that weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t from a gunshot, the police said.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt this time there is no evidence that the shooter knew the victims of this shooting or that individuals were specifically targeted,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the San Bruno Police Department said in a written statement.\\nWord of the attack in San Bruno at YouTube, which is owned by Google and is one of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest social media companies, quickly spread online through employees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 social media feeds.\\nVadim Lavrusik, a YouTube employee who formerly worked for The New York Times, tweeted just before 1 p.m. that there was an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cactive shooter at YouTube HQ\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that he had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cheard shots and saw people running while at my desk.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He was barricaded in a room with co-workers, he said, but moments later tweeted that he had been safely evacuated.\\nThe last known address for Ms. Aghdam was in Menifee, a city in Southern California about halfway between Los Angeles and San Diego.\\nMs. Aghdam was active on various social media outlets, including YouTube, where she had a number of channels in Persian, Turkish and English. On YouTube, she published an eclectic set of videos, including music parodies and workouts, on topics like animal cruelty and vegan cooking.\\nIn February 2017, she recorded a video on Facebook criticizing YouTube for taking measures that decreased the number of views on her videos.\\nShe said that she had contacted YouTube, but that the site\\xe2\\x80\\x99s support staff told her that her workout videos contained inappropriate scenes and needed to be restricted from younger audiences.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is what they are doing to vegan activists and many other people who try to promote healthy, humane and smart living \\xe2\\x80\\x94 people like me are not good for big business, like for animal business, medicine business and for many other businesses.

Two dozen attended the protest organized by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals against the use of pigs in military trauma training.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor me, animal rights equal human rights,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ms. Aghdam, then 29, who attended the protest carrying a plastic sword and wearing a wig and jeans painted with drops of blood.\\nThe shootings on Tuesday took place in a courtyard at YouTube\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offices, the police said. Those offices, like other Google facilities, maintain light security, with employees using badges to go through security gates or doors. Usually, the main lobby is attended by a receptionist. There are no visible metal detectors or armed guards.\\nSan Bruno is about nine miles south of San Francisco, with a population around 43,000. YouTube is the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s biggest employer, and many workers commute here from San Francisco. Though YouTube is owned by Google, it operates in a separate office, about 20 miles from Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s main campus in Mountain View, Calif.\\nOutside the YouTube headquarters, armed police officers waded into a crowd of 200 or so employees who had evacuated to a nearby parking lot Tuesday afternoon. The police asked for employees who had witnessed something firsthand to come forward, and about two dozen, some visibly distraught, walked over to the officers.\\nMany employees said they had initially thought the episode was a fire drill. Others said they had run when people started shouting that there was a shooter. Two hours after the attack, YouTube employees, including Susan Wojcicki, the chief executive, continued to stream slowly down the hill, away from the office.\\nFootage broadcast by CNN showed people leaving the building in single file with their hands raised above their heads. Separate footage showed a large crowd lining up to be frisked, one by one, by the police.\\nZach Vorhies, 37, a senior software engineer at YouTube, said in an interview that he had been sitting at his desk when the fire alarm went off. He grabbed his electric skateboard and headed for a back exit, he said. As he rode down a gravel hill, he heard someone shouting and saw a man lying motionless in one of the office\\xe2\\x80\\x99s outdoor dining areas.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe had a red spot on his stomach, and he was lying on his back, not moving,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Vorhies said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI saw the blood soak through the shirt.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAbout 25 feet away from the victim, he said, a man was shouting, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome at me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Vorhies thought the man was the attacker, but he did not see a gun and said it was possible that the man had actually \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbeen taunting the shooter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nA moment later, an armed police officer entered the patio area, and Mr. Vorhies quickly left, he said.\\nThe dining area can be reached from an adjacent parking structure without an employee badge, Mr. Vorhies said.\\nBy 2:15 p.m., President Trump had been briefed on the attack. He tweeted a short time later: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas just briefed on the shooting at YouTube\\xe2\\x80\\x99s HQ in San Bruno, California. Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved.

      "features:b'PHILADELPHIA \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Democratic Party leaders scrambled on Monday night to rescue their convention from political bedlam as supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders erupted in boos, jeers and protests against Hillary Clinton after an email leak showed that party officials had sought to undermine Mr. Sanders in their race for the nomination.\\nMr. Sanders, whose speech was shifted to a more prominent time in hopes of soothing delegates, struggled to unify the convention. His full-throated endorsement of Mrs. Clinton drew scattered boos, and his valedictory tone left some supporters in tears rather than rallying around the Democratic nominee. Another speaker, Michelle Obama, was far more electrifying, but while she drew affection from the crowd, her remarks did little to heal the lingering primary wounds.\\nThe venting among Sanders supporters reflected months of pent-up frustration after he lost the nomination to Mrs. Clinton, whom they see as too accommodating to big business and Republicans. Mr. Sanders tried to intervene by sending a text message asking delegates \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto not engage in any kind of protest on the floor,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d while Clinton and Sanders campaign officials worked on the convention floor to mollify delegates who might be disruptive.\\nThe tension reverberated from the floor of the hall to the stage. By 9:30 p.m., the outbursts were so loud and persistent that the comedian Sarah Silverman scolded the Sanders supporters who were shouting over her remarks.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan I just say to the Bernie-or-bust people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, adopting their own nickname, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou are being ridiculous.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAs delegates streamed out, a handful of Mr. Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most dedicated supporters held up his signs and chanted, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHey, hey, D.N.C., we won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t vote for Hillary.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nClinton campaign officials, in another bid to placate the party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s left wing, picked Senator Elizabeth Warren to deliver the keynote address on Monday night, hoping that her searing denunciations of Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, would unify the delegates in the hall. Mrs. Clinton had privately chosen Ms. Warren days ago, campaign officials said, but announced her on Monday morning to try to set a positive tone for the first day of the convention and start closing ranks against Mr. Trump.\\nMr. Sanders, who took the stage here at about 10:50 p.m. to a thundering three-minute ovation and chants of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBernie, Bernie,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d acknowledged the disappointment of his supporters and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is no secret that Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a number of issues.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut he said the choice between his onetime rival and Mr. Trump was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot even close.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHillary Clinton will make an outstanding president, and I am proud to stand with her here tonight,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Sanders said as his supporters waved his blue campaign signs.\\nMs. Warren opened her remarks with a warm nod to Mr. Sanders, saying his campaign had advanced liberal causes and helped show that the political and economic systems were \\xe2\\x80\\x9crigged\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in favor of the powerful.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBernie reminds us what Democrats fight for every day,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Warren said. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Thank you, Bernie.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nYet even after Ms. Warren was well into her remarks, a handful of determined supporters of Mr. Sanders tried to interrupt her. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe trusted you!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they yelled, suggesting that she had betrayed them by supporting Mrs. Clinton.\\nThese catcalls, as well as the images of delegates in Sanders T-shirts waving placards that read \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHill No,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were not the sort of messages that the Clinton campaign wanted. Mrs. Clinton, who had a hand in choosing the speakers, had hoped that the convention would be the picture of unity, in contrast to the Republican convention last week. Instead, she was reminded that many Americans, including some die-hard Democrats, do not like her or believe that she will bring significant change to the government.\\nThe only speaker who brought the entire hall together in spellbinding fashion was Michelle Obama, who seemed to pour out feelings she had been keeping under wraps. She delivered an unusually pointed speech targeting Mr. Trump without mentioning him by name.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe issues the president faces are not black and white, and cannot be boiled down to 140 characters,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, taking a crowd-pleasing shot at Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s penchant for Twitter messages.\\nShe alluded to those who have questioned Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccitizenship or faith\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and scorned Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s slogan. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let anyone tell you that this country isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t great,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. But she also turned emotional, her voice cracking, when she spoke of what Mrs. Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s election would mean.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy daughters, and all our sons and daughters, now take for granted that a woman can be president of the United States,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\nThroughout the day, more than 1,000 supporters of Mr. Sanders took to the scalding streets of Philadelphia to vent their frustration. Some targeted Mrs. Clinton with a taunting chant from last week\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Republican convention: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLock her up!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Other protesters gathered outside the downtown Ritz-Carlton, where many major donors to Mrs. Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign were staying, and attacked her use of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuper PAC\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and her reliance on big fund-raising events.\\nEven Mr. Sanders, who has vowed to do whatever it takes to stop Mr. Trump from winning, had little luck making the case to his followers that they should vote for Mrs. Clinton. In a rare display of rebellion at a lunchtime gathering of his delegates, he was drowned out by boos when he mentioned Mrs. Clinton, and seemed jarred by the response.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have got to defeat Donald Trump, and we have got to elect Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said to a round of jeers.\\nSeveral veterans of Democratic conventions said they had not seen anything at recent gatherings like Monday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disruptions. From the moment the gavel fell to open the convention at the Wells Fargo Center on Monday afternoon, Mr. Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supporters let out boos and jeers at almost any mention of Mrs. Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name.\\nSome Democratic officials said the fury was an illustration of the work that still needed to be done to unify the party behind Mrs. Clinton, as well as a sign of the dedication Mr. Sanders engendered over the last year.\\nThe Sanders supporters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 scorn was enough to prompt some of the speakers to gently scold them.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey both deserve our cheers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said former Mayor Wellington E. Webb of Denver, repeating the phrase twice more to make his point to the crowd.\\nBut the liberal anger in the hall was not only due to the belief among Mr. Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supporters that the party establishment had treated him unfairly. It was also driven by policy disagreements, underscoring the rifts between progressive activists and some Democratic leaders.\\nWhen Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, one of the most prominent black Democrats in Congress and a close ally of Mrs. Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, recounted his father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history as a sharecropper, he was nearly drowned out at times. Sign-waving progressives chanted in opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade accord that President Obama supports but Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton oppose.\\nSanders supporters directed their fury most intensely at Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the departing Democratic National Committee chairwoman, as she spoke to Florida delegates on Monday morning. Hopes that Ms. Wasserman Schultz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision on Sunday afternoon to resign would calm nerves were dashed as she publicly addressed her delegation at breakfast. Among those who believed for months that she was rigging the nominating fight, nothing would be forgiven so quickly.\\nThey booed and screamed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfair elections\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as Ms. Wasserman Schultz took the lectern and said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is so wonderful to be able to be here with my home state. All right, everybody, now, settle down. Everybody settle down, please.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThey refused.\\nAnd as the convention was called to order Monday afternoon, resentments bubbled to the surface. Some delegates booed every mention of Mrs. Clinton, while others waved Hillary buttons and chanted, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHill-a-ry!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe number of protesters in Philadelphia was strikingly larger than in Cleveland, where Republicans gathered for their convention last week. By around 5 p.m., roughly 30 people had climbed over a barrier outside the Wells Fargo Center and been arrested.\\nThe protesters reached the arena after marching at least three miles from City Hall in temperatures that reached into the mid-90s. Pressing anti-Clinton signs up against a temporary fence, they shouted at arriving delegates and erupted in cheers when the occasional Sanders delegate passed through.\\nChants of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBernie beats Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9chell no, D.N.C., we won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t vote for Hillary,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d echoed through the surrounding parking lots.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crooked as all get out,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Brianne Colling, of Canton, Mich. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll the proof that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming out is that she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stolen this election from Bernie.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'WASHINGTON \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Congress and the White House spent September bracing for a disruptive government shutdown, and most of October fretting over a possible default on the federal debt.\\nIn between, rebellious House Republicans ousted their speaker, John A. Boehner, and derailed his preferred successor, Kevin McCarthy, forcing the rest of their party to plead with a reluctant Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin to accept the gavel and try to control a majority that Mr. Boehner could not.\\nThen, suddenly \\xe2\\x80\\x94 almost implausibly \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a budget deal was delivered just before midnight on Monday, one that promises relative tranquillity if not a full-on d\\xc3\\xa9tente. The rancor that had defined Congress gave way to a complex 144-page bill. Its passage on Wednesday was virtually guaranteed before many lawmakers had a chance to read the table of contents.\\nEven when the House was in disarray, with Mr. Boehner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long career being brought low by the far-right Freedom Caucus, congressional leadership aides were negotiating with White House officials on the spending plan. But Mr. Boehner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s resignation freed him to work with his longtime counterpart, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, to clinch a deal and secure the needed votes.\\nThe outcome was in some ways so unlikely that the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, expressed concern that Americans might conclude something was amiss. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat has happened is nothing that should be alarming; it shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be a surprise,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Reid said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut it should be of interest to the American people: We did what we should be doing, sitting down and talking through our differences.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAs a result of the accord, officials said, congressional Republicans and the White House can return to the more conventional policy battles with stakes decidedly lower than a default or shutdown that could upend the global economy.\\nUnder the proposed deal, short-term expenditures, notably on military programs, would rise and long-term budget caps would remain in place. Meanwhile, spending priorities would be set the old-fashioned way, by seasoned lawmakers on Appropriations subcommittees.\\nFor sure, there will still be fights, and many may be magnified by the 2016 presidential race. And the next president will most likely confront a need to raise the federal debt ceiling within weeks of taking office.\\nThese and other consequences of their late-night landmark deal began coming into focus on Tuesday.\\nThe deal, which would increase spending by $80 billion over two years, is almost underwhelming in its modest size and scope. But after five years of all-out brawling, legislative gridlock and general dysfunction, that may be the inherent genius of it.\\nBy combining the relatively small spending increases, which temporarily break through the budget limitations loathed by Democrats, with small cuts to social programs loathed by Republicans, the accord reached Monday night seems to provide a compromise that will attract a solid majority of lawmakers in the House and Senate.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to see bricks flying from those that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like the fact that there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bipartisan agreement,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Boehner, who perhaps had more reason than anyone to celebrate a final achievement before leaving Congress at the end of the week. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut there it is. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a solid agreement. And I told my colleagues there isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t any reason why any member should vote against this.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nConservative Republicans in the House, however, said they hated the deal and how it had been pulled together, in negotiations behind closed doors.\\nEven as Mr. Ryan, who is expected to be elected the next speaker on Thursday, railed against the measure on television \\xe2\\x80\\x94 telling CNN that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe process stinks\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 he will start his job with a far less perilous agenda.\\nBut for the most part, Democrats and Republicans began lining up in support of the agreement.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMost importantly, we have affirmed that the full faith and credit of the United States is nonnegotiable and inviolable,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Pelosi said.\\nWith most of the 188 Democrats in the House expected to back the deal, it seemed that fewer than 50 of the chamber\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 247 Republicans would be needed to ensure its passage, which is expected in a floor vote on Wednesday.\\nThe Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said he would quickly take up the bill, and other Republicans predicted it would win swift approval.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think there will be bipartisan support,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 Republican, said on Tuesday.\\nThe White House, more relieved than rejoicing, also voiced support.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an actual bipartisan compromise, which hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been happening a lot in Washington recently,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Obama said during a speech to law enforcement officials in Chicago. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt allows us to plan for the future.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWhite House officials regarded the deal as a better one than they had dared to imagine even a few months ago, when the budget impasse with Republicans appeared to be careering toward another crisis.\\nMr. Boehner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s retirement announcement, on Sept. 25, changed all that, and he seemed emboldened by the prospect that he could \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclean out the barn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for his successor.\\nWhite House aides quickly conveyed that they would be happy to take up their mops and brooms.\\nIn the weeks since, Mr. Obama quietly dispatched Katie Beirne Fallon, his legislative affairs chief, and Brian Deese, his senior adviser and a longtime economic aide, to work out the details with aides to House and Senate leaders from both parties.

      "features:b'\"Errol Louis is the host of \"Inside City Hall,\" a nightly political show on NY1, a New York all-news channel. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\"\\n(CNN)Hillary Clinton\\'s lawyerly news conference Tuesday, at which she doggedly parried suggestions that her use of a private email server to conduct official State Department business was improper, might extinguish the matter for most Americans -- but it doesn\\'t get Clinton out of the woods politically.\\nThe real possibility of lasting political damage to the former secretary of state will come if her emails reveal any favoritism to any of the foreign donors who contributed to the welter of powerful charitable organizations housed at the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. This is the multibillion-dollar foundation Hillary Clinton leads alongside ex-President Bill Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea.\\nWhat we already know about the foundation\\'s donors is controversial: Some of the corporations, banks and foreign governments that have funded foundation projects have abysmal human rights records and have been involved in everything from drug money laundering to aiding terrorism in violation of American law.\\nThe Clintons can make a plausible case that it\\'s best to solicit money from companies and foreign governments -- even ethically challenged ones -- and put it to good use attacking problems of global poverty.\\nAs Bill Clinton recently told reporters: \"You\\'ve got to decide when you do this work whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country.\"\\nIt\\'s an interesting and important debate, and most Americans would probably approve the idea of putting \"bad\" money to good use. But the argument only works if Clinton\\'s work as secretary of state was completely separate from the foundation\\'s tip-toeing around ethical challenges.\\nTo figure that out requires analyzing the history of what began as the William J. Clinton Foundation shortly after he left office in 2001. Different initiatives were added over the years to combat AIDS, climate change, poverty and other ills; the most high-profile of these projects, the Clinton Global Initiative, added in 2005, brings world leaders together to tackle the world\\'s problems.\\nTo make things even more complicated, the foundation\\'s website says its mission is supported by the Clinton Presidential Center in Arkansas, which includes an archive of the President\\'s papers. The foundation recently co-sponsored a Black History month event with the center.\\nThe foundation\\'s thicket of relationships with corporate donors and foreign heads of states is difficult for outsiders to penetrate and understand. And with 350 employees spread across 180 nations, running the foundation is an expensive proposition: in 2012, the various initiatives spent $214 million according to The New York Times but still ended up $8 million in the red.\\nWho gave, and why, is hard to figure out. According to The Wall Street Journal, \"The Clinton Foundation does disclose its donors, which isn\\'t required by law. But the disclosure is limited; dates and exact amount of the donations aren\\'t disclosed. Donations are listed in value ranges and updated annually with only the previous year\\'s donor getting an asterisk by his or her name.\"\\nHillary and Bill Clinton have put some safeguards in place to put distance between her job as secretary of state and the inner workings of the foundation.\\nDuring Hillary Clinton\\'s years as secretary of state, the high-profile Clinton Global Initiative split off from the larger Clinton Foundation, and Bill Clinton says he had no direct involvement in its day-to-day operations. Hillary Clinton also stayed away from the foundation during her time at the State Department and agreed to subject possible conflicts to the department\\'s ethics office. It was only after she resigned that she formally joined the foundation and added her name to its title.\\nIdeally that would settle the matter, but there\\'s the possibility that the elaborate formal safeguards may have been breached or ignored.\\nAn investigation by The Wall Street Journal found that \"at least 60 companies that lobbied the State Department during her tenure donated a total of more than $26 million to the Clinton Foundation,\" raising questions about whether the firms were using the donations to curry favor with the secretary of state.\\nIn one well-publicized case, Hillary pressed a state-owed Russian airline to buy American planes from Boeing. The effort worked: Boeing ended up with a $3.7 billion contract. (To be sure, secretaries of state are always lobbying foreign countries to purchase American products. It\\'s part of their job.) But weeks after Clinton\\'s persuasion (what she called a \"shameless pitch\"), Boeing donated $900,000 to the foundation.\\nA CNN investigation by Alexandra Jaffe recently showed that half a dozen banks that gave money to the Clinton Foundation were involved in ethically questionable behavior and might have used donations to the foundation and/or its CGI spinoff as a way to gain favor with the Clintons and enhance their tarnished reputations.\\nIn 2012, the British bank Standard Chartered paid $667 million in fines for violating sanctions against Iran and HSBC paid $1.92 billion to settle claims of illegally doing business for customers in Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Myanmar and allowing drug dealers to launder money through the bank.\\nBoth banks have been major contributors to the foundation. As Jaffe notes, \"the fact that the foundation partnered with banks that were actively under investigation raises questions over what restrictions, if any, the foundation placed on its fundraising operation.\"\\nAnd according to The Washington Post, seven nations donated millions to the foundation during Clinton\\'s time as secretary of state, including a $500,000 gift from Algeria that the foundation failed to clear in advance through the State Department\\'s ethics office.\\nThat sort of corner-cutting, and the cozy-seeming connections between Clinton and various corporations and governments, will be tough to explain on the campaign trail.\\nIf emails suggest Clinton was aware of the corporations, banks and nations sending money to her foundation during her time at the State Department -- or worse, took action to help encourage the flow of donations -- the issue would almost certainly derail her likely presidential campaign.\\nIt\\'s much too early to count Hillary out, of course.\\nThe Clintons can credibly argue that the money they collected has funded more than a billion dollars\\' worth of good works, from lowering the price of HIV-fighting drugs in developing countries to advancing green technology and educating girls and women.\\nBut there\\'s no scenario in which voters can be expected to ignore or support the former secretary of state if she is shown to have been simultaneously arranging pay-to-play deals with businesses and governments seeking help or favors from the U.S. government while she was in office.\\nWhat will matter is not why or how Hillary stored her emails but whether the actual emails show her in ethical quicksand from which no presidential candidate can escape.\\nRead CNNOpinion\\'s new Flipboard magazine.\\nFollow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.\\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'Gen. Bob Scales, who has known the former VA secretary for 40 years, reflects on the mixed signals sent before and after he stepped down amid scandal\\nPresident Obama announced Friday that embattled Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki would take the fall for the rapidly growing scandal over veterans&apos health care, accepting his resignation under pressure from members of both parties.\\n[audio-clip]\\nThe president announced that Shinseki would resign after they met at the White House and he received an update on an internal review of the problems at the VA. The review showed the problems were not limited to just a few facilities, Obama said, adding: \"It&aposs totally unacceptable. Our veterans deserve the best.\"\\nOn the heels of those and other findings, Obama said, \"Secretary Shinseki offered me his own resignation -- with considerable regret, I accepted.\"\\nHe said Shinseki told him he did not want to be a distraction. \"I agree,\" Obama said. \"We don&apost have time for distractions. We need to fix the problem.\"\\nThe president had faced mounting calls from members of both parties to remove Shinseki; those calls accelerated after a damning inspector general report on Wednesday. Shinseki suffered another blow on Friday when Rep. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., a former top VA official, called for her former boss&apos resignation.\\nShinseki&aposs departure is likely to calm the political storm, but only briefly. Congressional critics of VA leadership voiced support for the decision on Friday, but urged the administration to quickly get to the root of the problems with VA workers lying about patient wait times.\\n\"VA&aposs problems are deadly serious, and whomever the next secretary may be, they will receive no grace period from America&aposs veterans, American taxpayers and Congress,\" Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, said in a statement.\\nHouse Speaker John Boehner said the resignation \"does not absolve the president.\" The resignation also has not muted calls for the Justice Department to launch a criminal probe.\\nSen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., and Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said in a joint statement that they would continue to push a bill providing resources for such a probe. \"This scandal has dragged on over a decade. We believe the Department of Justice should begin investigations right away,\" they said.\\nThe president, who for weeks stood by Shinseki as the allegations of wrongdoing mounted, said it was Shinseki&aposs own judgment that he&aposd be a distraction that changed his mind. The president said Sloan Gibson, deputy VA secretary, would be named acting VA secretary while the administration seeks a permanent replacement.\\nIn his farewell message to staff, Shinseki touted \"significant and lasting progress in expanding access\" for veterans over the last several years, while acknowledging \"there is more work to be done.\"\\nEarlier Friday morning, Shinseki publicly apologized for the failures in the VA system. Responding to an interim inspector general report which found \"systemic\" problems with clinics misrepresenting patient wait times, Shinseki also announced he would oust senior leaders at the Phoenix VA, where allegations of improper scheduling practices first surfaced.\\nShinseki, speaking to advocates for homeless veterans, said he initially believed the problems were \"limited and isolated.\"\\n\"I no longer believe that. It is systemic,\" Shinseki said. \"I will not defend it, because it is indefensible.\"\\nEven before his meeting with the president, the secretary&aposs tone shifted dramatically compared with his testimony before a congressional committee earlier this month, when he continued to defend the VA system. On Friday, citing the IG report, he lamented a \"totally unacceptable lack of integrity\" at numerous VA facilities -- where reviews have found workers were manipulating wait times to make their internal figures look good.\\nShinseki said the \"lack of integrity\" is something he has \"rarely encountered.\" He announced several steps to address the situation, including directing that patient wait times no longer be used as a measure of success in employee evaluations.\\nThe internal audit reviewed by Obama on Friday outlined additional problems, including findings that VA staff were pressured to use improper practices. The report said in some cases, \"pressures were placed on schedulers to utilize inappropriate practices in order to make Waiting Times appear more favorable.\"\\nThe report said the practices were \"pervasive\" enough to \"require VA re-examine its entire Performance Management system.\"' target:1\n",
      "features:b'CBS Corporation announced on Sunday that chairman and CEO Leslie Moonves is departing the company, effective immediately. Moonves\\' exit comes hours after The New Yorker published accounts from six women with allegations of sexual assault or misconduct, following allegations by six other women in July.\\nA financial exit package for Moonves will be withheld pending the results of an ongoing investigation into the allegations against him. Moonves was eligible for as much as $180 million if fired without cause, according to an employment contract he signed in May 2017. Recent reports indicated a potential payout in the range of $100 million. A filing from CBS with the SEC on Monday morning said the potential payout is $120 million.\\nCBS will donate $20 million to one or more organizations that support the #MeToo movement and equality for women in the workplace. The donation will be made within 30 days, the SEC filing said. The company\\'s statement on Sunday indicated that the $20 million had been deducted from the amount Moonves could potentially receive. The SEC filing does not refer to a deduction.\\nJoseph Ianniello, the current Chief Operating Officer and deputy to Moonves, will serve as interim CEO while the board searches for a permanent leader.\\nMoonves, 68, has run CBS since 2006 and his exit marks a dramatic fall by one by the most powerful executives in Hollywood.\\nThe allegations, reported by Ronan Farrow, include forced kissing, forced oral sex, unwanted advances and physical abuse. Some of the women say Moonves retaliated against them and that their careers suffered after they rebuffed his advances.\\nMoonves has denied the allegations against him. In a new statement to The New Yorker, Moonves acknowledged three of the encounters but said they were consensual. He did not tell The New Yorker which three he was acknowledging.\\n\"The appalling accusations in this article are untrue,\" the statement reads. \"What is true is that I had consensual relations with three of the women some 25 years ago before I came to CBS. And I have never used my position to hinder the advancement or careers of women. In my 40 years of work, I have never before heard of such disturbing accusations. I can only surmise they are surfacing now for the first time, decades later, as part of a concerted effort by others to destroy my name, my reputation, and my career. Anyone who knows me knows that the person described in this article is not me.\"\\nFarrow said the women who made allegations in his most recent story had no connection to the \"corporate battles\" at CBS.\\nIn August, the CBS board of directors hired two outside law firms to investigate the initial claims against Moonves, as well as other reports of sexual harassment and an inappropriate culture for women throughout CBS and the CBS News division.\\nJeffrey Fager, the executive producer of \"60 Minutes,\" was accused by former employees of inappropriate conduct in the initial New Yorker story in July. He has denied the allegations.\\nSunday\\'s report from Farrow also includes a new allegation against Fager. Sarah Johansen, who was an intern in the late 2000s, says Fager once groped her at an office function and described the culture as \"sexist\" and a \"boy\\'s club.\"\\nMoonves joined the former CBS Corporation in 1995 as president of CBS Entertainment. He has been chairman and CEO of CBS Corporation since 2006. In the late 1980s, he was an executive at Lorimar Television.\\nCBS owns the CBS TV network, cable network Showtime and the publisher Simon & Schuster.\\nMoonves had been in a corporate battle with Shari Redstone, controlling shareholder in CBS through her company National Amusements, which also controls Viacom.\\nViacom controls several major cable networks, including Comedy Central, MTV and BET, and movie studio Paramount.\\nRedstone had been pushing to merge CBS and Viacom, and Moonves had opposed the move.\\nAs part of the agreement announced Sunday, Redstone agreed that the company would not pursue a combination of CBS and Viacom for at least two years.\\n\"Today\\'s resolution will benefit all shareholders, allowing us to focus on the business of running CBS \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and transforming it for the future. We are confident in Joe\\'s ability to serve as acting CEO,\" Redstone said.\\nViacom and CBS first merged in 1999, and split up in 2005. At the time, the bet was that Viacom had the greater growth potential. But under Moonves, CBS\\' stock has soared while Viacom\\'s has been relatively flat.\\nThat turned Moonves into one of this highest paid executives in America: He took home nearly $70 million in each of the past two years.\\nNote: This story has been updated with new information from an SEC filing Monday morning.' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'WASHINGTON \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Around 8 p.m. Thursday, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader, called Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York into his office with news that would stun Washington the next morning: Mr. Reid planned to retire at the end of his term.\\nMr. Reid\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to contact Mr. Schumer first, before even President Obama, was another powerful reminder of what Senate Democrats have long known: Mr. Schumer \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the flip-phone using, rumpled, relentless son of a Brooklyn exterminator \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is the presumptive front-runner to lead the Senate Democrats when Mr. Reid is gone.\\nIn that moment, Mr. Schumer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possibilities finally caught up with his ambition.\\nJust hours after Mr. Reid announced his retirement, throwing the future of his caucus into flux, at least one thing was clear: The Democratic leader post that Mr. Schumer has long coveted is his to lose.\\nMr. Reid, demonstrating the steely will with which he has ruled his conference, worked aggressively to anoint Mr. Schumer, the No. 3 Democrat, as his successor shortly after beginning to tell people that he would not seek re-election, effectively edging out Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat. Mr. Durbin later said that he, too, would back Mr. Schumer.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe will be elected to replace me in 22 months,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Reid told Nevada Public Radio. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think one reason that will happen is because I want him to be my replacement.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMr. Schumer spent most of the day calling lawmakers to lock down their support for his leadership bid, which he officially announced Friday afternoon, saying in statement, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am honored and humbled to have the support of so many of my colleagues and look forward to our Senate Democratic caucus continuing to fight for the middle class.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAfter more than three decades in Congress, Mr. Schumer, 64, has a reputation nationally as an institutional presence in the baroque Senate chamber and the green rooms of the Sunday talk shows. But his potential ascent to the top Democratic post also represents a boon for New York, where Mr. Schumer cut his teeth with his rapacious attention to local issues, one Sunday morning news conference at a time.\\nNew York has never produced a leader of the Senate, and it has been more than a century since a New Yorker was speaker of the House.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNew York is very fortunate that we will have someone with his abilities and talents to help our state,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said former Senator Alfonse M. D\\xe2\\x80\\x99Amato, a Republican whom Mr. Schumer unseated in a contentious 1998 battle, but who now describes him as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca tiger\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on Capitol Hill. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe will do exactly that \\xe2\\x80\\x94 use that power and that clout.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nUnlike the frequently endangered Mr. Reid \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and the previous Democratic Senate leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Mr. Schumer, who was first elected to the House in 1980, has proved seemingly unbeatable on his home turf. He has not faced a competitive campaign since his first election to the Senate, as he has kept the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Democratic community united around him.\\nThat same indefatigable relationship building has also helped him in the Senate. Mr. Durbin and Mr. Schumer, who were once longtime roommates in Washington, have jockeyed for years behind the scenes, at times tensely, over who would replace Mr. Reid. Mr. Durbin plans to run again for the No. 2 position, and has Mr. Reid\\xe2\\x80\\x99s endorsement.\\nMr. Schumer, a master tactician and inveterate deal maker, ran the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 2006, when Democrats retook control of the Senate, and again in 2008, when they increased their majority. Mr. Schumer also earned the respect and trust of more moderate Democrats, who view him as someone eager to get things done and often call him when they have a concern or problem.\\nShortly after the 2014 midterm elections, when Democrats lost their majority, some Democrats who had chafed under Mr. Reid\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leadership urged Mr. Schumer to challenge Mr. Reid for minority leader. But Mr. Schumer quickly quashed the plan, out of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cloyalty and friendship\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to Mr. Reid, said someone close to Mr. Schumer, speaking anonymously to discuss a sensitive topic.\\nSenator Patty Murray of Washington, the No. 4 Democrat, is also interested in remaining in her party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leadership, though she is not actively campaigning for a specific post.\\nWhile some progressive groups called for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to consider running, Democrats have mentioned Ms. Murray as the most likely senator to pose a possible challenge for Mr. Schumer. She ran the party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Senate Campaign Committee in 2012, is well liked and respected by her colleagues, and has a natural base of support among her party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 14 female members.\\nThough the official vote is nearly two years away, after the 2016 elections, the Democratic leadership was eager for a smooth transition, and at least a tacit understanding of who will replace Mr. Reid.\\nIn New York, where Mr. Schumer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prowess as a retail politician is often on display, his possible elevation was cause for instant celebration.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know when the last time was when we had someone in such a position,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Representative Joseph Crowley of Queens, adding, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be at the head of the table, and I think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something that we haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily had.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn contrast with other prominent New York officials, including Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, Mr. Schumer has never become a divisive figure, focusing insistently on the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economic interests and local concerns, rather than on ideological crusades.\\nMr. Crowley said Mr. Schumer has attended nearly every meeting of the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s delegation, both in Washington and back home. When Mr. Crowley sought a House leadership post in 2012, he said he sought advice from Mr. Schumer, who helped rally the delegation behind him.\\nMr. Schumer has continued to work the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s circuit of local parades and association dinners even as he has climbed the ranks of national leadership, making frequent visits to upstate cities, including Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I get together with him, I can get through a list of 10 issues in 45 seconds,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mayor Stephanie A. Miner of Syracuse. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBetween talking fast and talking on two or three flip-phones at any one time, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always extraordinarily responsive.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nNew York City politicians called Mr. Schumer an omnipresent force, regularly seen riding his bike around the city and showing up at swearing-in ceremonies for all manner of state and local officeholders.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s everywhere in the state and has been for a long time now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said State Senator Daniel L.

Biden called the move an unprecedented affront \"designed to undercut a sitting president.\"\\n\"In thirty-six years in the United States Senate, I cannot recall another instance in which Senators wrote directly to advise another country -- much less a longtime foreign adversary -- that the President does not have the constitutional authority to reach a meaningful understanding with them.

They have historically been upheld by U.S. courts.\\nBiden, a longtime senator and former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also criticized the author of the letter, freshman Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), for willfully sabotaging the negotiations.

Each candidate embraced the most self-serving Empire State clich\\xc3\\xa9 they could glom \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Bernie Sanders trumpeted his Spaldeen-stoopball 1950s Brooklyn upbringing (while eliding the endemic segregation in his fiercely divided neighborhood), Hillary touted her 2000 upstate listening tour (downplaying her coziness with Wall Street), while actual Americans Ted Cruz and John Kasich seemed mesmerized by the wild exoticism of half-sour pickles and matzas.\\nOnly Donald Trump \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBonfire of the Vanities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d character who has busted out of his tabloid 1980s cage to devour 2016 basic-cable America \\xe2\\x80\\x94 seemed to really get what New Yorkers wanted. Which was to be momentarily amused, then left the hell alone. By necessity (no riots, please!) and instinct (he has Jeter-esque name recognition already) the Donald lay lower than in any previous contest and triumphed resoundingly.\\nIt was semi-fun while it lasted. Here are five takeaways from the New York primary.\\n1\\\\. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMomentum\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is for losers. Bernie Sanders cruised into New York riding a wave of victories: He won eight out of the past nine nominating contests. Which all added up to not very much \\xe2\\x80\\x94 he cut Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lead in pledged delegates from about 240 to under 200. The Sanders campaign \\xe2\\x80\\x94 taking a page from Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own effort in 2008 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 has been pushing the idea that the Vermont senator was surging past the mathematical impediments to his nomination.\\nClinton nearly erased that run with one big win in New York, a victory that her staff expected to net her about 20 to 25 pledged delegates. It also robbed Sanders of a core (if flawed) rationale for his candidacy: That Clinton couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win consistently in big, Northern states \\xe2\\x80\\x94 she can add New York to a column of wins that includes Florida, Texas, Virginia and Ohio.\\nAnd late in the day came news that electrified Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s already-jazzed staff: that Sanders had unexpectedly flown back to Vermont to recharge his political batteries.\\n2\\\\. Trump: The mouth that didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t roar. Turns out that shutting up, lying low and reorganizing your amateurish campaign ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t such a bad idea. Trump, who kicked off his candidacy at Trump Tower on Fifth took the Fifth during his home-state primary \\xe2\\x80\\x94 steering clear of perilously liberal Manhattan to hold rallies in Patchogue on Long Island and Rochester upstate.\\nIt may be too late to showcase restraint, but Trump (who attempted rapprochement with Megyn Kelly during the primary sprint) used his dead-certain win here as cover to reset his campaign \\xe2\\x80\\x94 layering over bar-bouncer campaign manager Corey Lewandowski with seasoned GOP pro Paul Manafort and flack Hope Hicks with former Scott Walker aide Rick Wiley.\\n3\\\\. Bernie and Hillary officially hate each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guts. Here was a hometown contest destined to sow bitterness. Sanders (like so many other Brooklynites) professes to be proud of the moxie and street toughness instilled by the borough of his birth, but his first-ever vote was with his feet \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and he got out, first to Chicago, then to the braying-Guernsey environs of Burlington. Still, he feels pride of ownership and bragged (in Wyoming) that he would make New York transplant Clinton quake; Clinton, who parked her carpetbag in Chappaqua 15 years ago, wanted to crush his upstart challenge in her Chappaqua backyard \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and she did.\\nClinton won by a wide margin\\xe2\\x80\\x94 and there was much eff-you high-fiving in the ballroom of the Sheraton New York. But Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 defeat (accompanied, as always by the big crowds and even bigger torrent of online donations) was the bitterest one yet and deepened the already yawning fault lines between the Bernie stalwarts and a Clinton team increasingly itchy to see him gone. Not going to happen anytime soon, apparently: The tweet being incredulously digested at a Clinton victory party was an MSNBC report quoting Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver defiantly claiming his candidate would take the fight to the convention floor \\xe2\\x80\\x94 even if Clinton secured an overwhelming lead among pledged delegates and supers.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe kicked his ass tonight,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a senior Clinton aide told me Tuesday night. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope this convinces Bernie to tone it down. If not, f--- him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n4\\\\. Why is John Kasich still running? Sure, Donald Trump built (or branded himself on) over half of Manhattan. But Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the closest thing to a moderate remaining in the Republican field should have appealed to voters here \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make the sale in critical areas like Nassau County or suburban Buffalo. At 11 p.m. he was clocking in at a modest 25 percent \\xe2\\x80\\x94 less than half of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s commanding 60 percent level of victory.\\nKasich stands no chance of catching either Trump or Ted Cruz in the delegate hunt\\xe2\\x80\\x94 so his core rationale is that he fares far better than either man in a general election match-up against Hillary Clinton. Losing so badly in her home state, however, does little to bolster that case \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and the trickle of cash coming to his campaign is likely to dry up as he heads into the homestretch.\\n5\\\\. Whiteout. Clinton managed to fight Sanders to a virtual draw among white voters statewide (and won 60-to-40 among whites in the five boroughs) \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but the big story, for the umpteenth time in 2016 was Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 inability to make significant inroads with black voters. Spike Lee made a nice ad for the Vermont senator \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but it couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t compensate for the candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s repeated (and inexplicable) dismissal of Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s huge wins in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDeep South\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which blacks interpreted as a slight.' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'WASHINGTON \\xe2\\x80\\x94 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\\'s comments about sexual harassment allegations in her party\\'s own ranks touched off a fierce blowback not only from Republicans, but also from progressives, who said they feared it muddled the Democrats\\' message on misconduct by putting politics ahead of protecting women.\\nIn an interview Sunday on NBC\\'s \"Meet the Press,\" Pelosi, D-Calif., offered supportive words for Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., who has been accused of sexually harassing former members of his congressional staff and who reached a taxpayer-funded settlement with one accuser who said she was fired for rejecting his advances.\\nPelosi praised Conyers, who has denied the allegations, as an \"icon,\" questioned the identity of his accusers and declined to call for his resignation \\xe2\\x80\\x94 all within moments of having hailed the \"zero tolerance\" movement against sexual misconduct as \"transformative ... so wholesome, so refreshing, so different.\"\\nPelosi\\'s comments were criticized as tone-deaf and a bad flub \\xe2\\x80\\x94 one that diluted the message that Democrats want to be sending on sexual misconduct, particularly in light of Roy Moore\\'s Senate campaign in Alabama and President Donald Trump\\'s support for him.\\n\"I\\'m trying to think of a political interview in recent history that\\'s been as damaging to a politician, simply because she was so unprepared and could not answer questions about a huge crisis that is sweeping across the nation and so many industries, not just politics,\" said Elise Jordan, a Republican strategist and MSNBC analyst.\\n\"I think that Democrats on Capitol Hill are underestimating the movement that\\'s happening right now and the tenor of the nation when it comes to zero tolerance for sexual harassment and sexual assault. It\\'s another example of Washington protecting their own \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they\\'re protecting the boys who are in the club,\" Jordan added. \"It\\'s about the ties of the club, the bonds of the club, and no one will defy that even when it\\'s a question of morality and standards from the party that ostensibly says they support women.\"\\nAs Democrats also wrestle with groping allegations against Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., Pelosi\\'s remarks raised questions about the credibility of the party\\'s messaging and the degree to which its elected leaders are willing to put the protection of women ahead of political considerations. Some Democrats worried that they came at the cost of drawing a distinction with Trump and Moore.\\n\"We have no moral high ground against the likes of Roy Moore if we sit by in silence when Al Franken and John Conyers get to sit in their seats,\" Democratic strategist Lis Smith said. \"We can\\'t be the party that says we stand up for women only when it\\'s politically convenient \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we have to apply the same standards to ourselves.\"\\nAmid a torrent of criticism from progressive activists \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and as Republicans called her a hypocrite \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Pelosi tried to limit any fallout.\\nConyers, who Democratic aides said already had agreed before Pelosi went on camera Sunday to temporarily step away from his post as the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, made his plans public shortly after her appearance. Then Pelosi issued a her own statement after the interview, stressing the seriousness of sexual misconduct allegations.\\n\"Zero tolerance means consequences,\" Pelosi said in the later statement, noting that she had called for an ethics investigation into Conyers. \"We are at a watershed moment on this issue, and no matter how great an individual\\'s legacy, it is not a license for harassment. I commend the brave women coming forward.\"\\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers declined to make on-the-record comments about Pelosi\\'s remarks, not wanting to make a bad situation worse for her.\\nSome junior members of the Democratic caucus have long grumbled that Pelosi should consider stepping aside to allow younger leaders to rise and because they fear that the Republican Party will try to make an issue of her in the midterm elections next year. But one lawmaker and two veteran Democratic aides said Sunday that they didn\\'t think the interview would cost her support among House Democrats.\\n\"This is not going to move the numbers in any substantial way,\" the lawmaker said.\\nBut for the silence about Pelosi\\'s comments among Democrats in Congress, beyond the Capitol, there was concern that Democrats need to speak clearly on the issue of sexual misconduct.\\nNomiki Konst, a former member of the Democratic National Committee and a surrogate for Sen. Bernie Sanders\\' 2016 presidential campaign, said Democratic leaders are in a \"prickly position\" when lawmakers who have advanced women\\'s rights are themselves accused of sexual misconduct.\\n\"There is no doubt that Nancy Pelosi is a feminist and that she has stood by women,\" Konst said, \"but this is a moment when we really need to say, \\'How are we going to look back on this in 20 years?\\'\"\\nJonathan Allen is a Washington-based national political reporter for NBC News who focuses on the presidency.' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'WASHINGTON \\xe2\\x80\\x94 President Obama on Wednesday ordered the restoration of full diplomatic relations with Cuba and the opening of an embassy in Havana for the first time in more than a half-century as he vowed to \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccut loose the shackles of the past\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and sweep aside one of the last vestiges of the Cold War.\\nThe surprise announcement came at the end of 18 months of secret talks that produced a prisoner swap negotiated with the help of Pope Francis and concluded by a telephone call between Mr. Obama and President Ra\\xc3\\xbal Castro. The historic deal broke an enduring stalemate between two countries divided by just 90 miles of water but oceans of mistrust and hostility dating from the days of Theodore Roosevelt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charge up San Juan Hill and the nuclear brinkmanship of the Cuban missile crisis.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe will end an outdated approach that for decades has failed to advance our interests, and instead we will begin to normalize relations between our two countries,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Obama said in a nationally televised statement from the White House. The deal, he added, will \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbegin a new chapter among the nations of the Americas\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and move beyond a \\xe2\\x80\\x9crigid policy that is rooted in events that took place before most of us were born.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn doing so, Mr. Obama ventured into diplomatic territory where the last 10 presidents refused to go, and Republicans, along with a senior Democrat, quickly characterized the rapprochement with the Castro family as appeasement of the hemisphere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leading dictatorship. Republican lawmakers who will take control of the Senate as well as the House next month made clear they would resist lifting the 54-year-old trade embargo.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis entire policy shift announced today is based on an illusion, on a lie, the lie and the illusion that more commerce and access to money and goods will translate to political freedom for the Cuban people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida and son of Cuban immigrants. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll this is going to do is give the Castro regime, which controls every aspect of Cuban life, the opportunity to manipulate these changes to perpetuate itself in power.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nFor good or ill, the move represented a dramatic turning point in relations with an island that for generations has captivated and vexed its giant northern neighbor. From the 18th century, when successive presidents coveted it, Cuba loomed large in the American imagination long before Fidel Castro stormed from the mountains and seized power in 1959.\\nMr. Castro\\xe2\\x80\\x99s alliance with the Soviet Union made Cuba a geopolitical flash point in a global struggle of ideology and power. President Dwight D. Eisenhower imposed the first trade embargo in 1960 and broke off diplomatic relations in January 1961, just weeks before leaving office and seven months before Mr. Obama was born. Under President John F. Kennedy, the failed Bay of Pigs operation aimed at toppling Mr. Castro in April 1961 and the 13-day showdown over Soviet missiles installed in Cuba the following year cemented its status as a ground zero in the Cold War.\\nBut the relationship remained frozen in time long after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union, a thorn in the side of multiple presidents who waited for Mr. Castro\\xe2\\x80\\x99s demise and experienced false hope when he passed power to his brother, Ra\\xc3\\xbal. Even as the United States built relations with Communist nations like China and Vietnam, Cuba remained one of just a few nations, along with Iran and North Korea, that had no formal ties with Washington.\\nMr. Obama has long expressed hope of transforming relations with Cuba and relaxed some travel restrictions in 2011. But further moves remained untenable as long as Cuba held Alan P. Gross, an American government contractor arrested in 2009 and sentenced to 15 years in a Cuban prison for trying to deliver satellite telephone equipment capable of cloaking connections to the Internet.\\nAfter winning re-election, Mr. Obama resolved to make Cuba a priority for his second term and authorized secret negotiations led by two aides, Benjamin J. Rhodes and Ricardo Z\\xc3\\xba\\xc3\\xb1iga, who conducted nine meetings with Cuban counterparts starting in June 2013, most of them in Canada, which has ties with Havana.\\nPope Francis encouraged the talks with letters to Mr. Obama and Mr. Castro and had the Vatican host a meeting in October to finalize the terms of the deal. Mr. Obama spoke with Mr. Castro by telephone on Tuesday to seal the agreement in a call that lasted more than 45 minutes, the first direct substantive contact between the leaders of the two countries in more than 50 years.\\nOn Wednesday morning, Mr. Gross walked out of a Cuban prison and boarded an American military plane that flew him to Washington, accompanied by his wife, Judy. While eating a corned beef sandwich on rye bread with mustard during the flight, Mr. Gross received a call from Mr. Obama. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s back where he belongs, in America with his family, home for Hanukkah,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Obama said later.\\nFor its part, the United States sent back three imprisoned Cuban spies who were caught in 1998 and had become a cause c\\xc3\\xa9l\\xc3\\xa8bre for the Havana government. They were swapped for Rolando Sarraff Trujillo, a Cuban who had worked as an agent for American intelligence and had been in a Cuban prison for nearly 20 years, according to a senior American official. Mr. Gross was not technically part of the swap, officials said, but was released separately on \\xe2\\x80\\x9chumanitarian grounds,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a distinction critics found unpersuasive.\\nThe United States will ease restrictions on remittances, travel and banking, while Cuba will allow more Internet access and release 53 Cubans identified as political prisoners by the United States. Although the embargo will remain in place, the president called for an \\xe2\\x80\\x9chonest and serious debate about lifting\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it, which would require an act of Congress.\\nMr. Castro spoke simultaneously on Cuban television, taking to the airwaves with no introduction and announcing that he had spoken by telephone with Mr. Obama on Tuesday.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have been able to make headway in the solution of some topics of mutual interest for both nations,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he declared, emphasizing the release of the three Cubans. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPresident Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision deserves the respect and acknowledgment of our people.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nOnly afterward did Mr. Castro mention the reopening of diplomatic relations. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis in no way means that the heart of the matter has been resolved,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe economic, commercial and financial blockade, which causes enormous human and economic damages to our country, must cease.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But, he added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe progress made in our exchanges proves that it is possible to find solutions to many problems.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMr. Obama is gambling that restoring ties with Cuba may no longer be politically unthinkable with the generational shift among Cuban-Americans, where many younger children of exiles are open to change. Nearly six in 10 Americans support re-establishing relations with Cuba, according to a New York Times poll conducted in October. Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s move had the support of the Catholic Church, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Human Rights Watch and major agricultural interests.\\nAt a news conference in Washington, Mr. Gross said he supported Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s move toward normalizing relations with Cuba, adding that his own ordeal and the injustice with which Cuban people had been treated were \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca consequence of two governments\\xe2\\x80\\x99 mutually belligerent policies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFive and a half decades of history show us that such belligerence inhibits better judgment,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTwo wrongs never make a right. This is a game-changer, which I fully support.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut leading Republicans, including Speaker John A. Boehner and the incoming Senate majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, did not. In addition to Mr. Rubio, two other Republican potential candidates for president joined in the criticism. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas called it a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery, very bad deal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d while former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida said it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cundermines the quest for a free and democratic Cuba.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nA leading Democrat agreed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a fallacy that Cuba will reform just because the American president believes that if he extends his hand in peace, that the Castro brothers suddenly will unclench their fists,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the outgoing chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and a Cuban-American.\\nWhile the United States has no embassy in Havana, there is a bare-bones facility called an interests section that can be upgraded, currently led by a diplomat, Jeffrey DeLaurentis, who will become the charg\\xc3\\xa9 d\\xe2\\x80\\x99affaires pending the nomination and confirmation of an ambassador.\\nMr. Obama has instructed Secretary of State John Kerry to begin the process of removing Cuba from the list of states that sponsor terrorism, and the president announced that he would attend a regional Summit of the Americas next spring that Mr. Castro is also to attend. Mr. Obama will send an assistant secretary of state to Havana next month to talk about migration, and Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker may lead a commercial mission.\\nMr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision will ease travel restrictions for family visits, public performances, and professional, educational and religious activities, among other things, but ordinary tourism will still be banned under the law. Mr. Obama will also allow greater banking ties, making it possible to use credit and debit cards in Cuba, and American travelers will be allowed to import up to $400 worth of goods from Cuba, including up to $100 in tobacco and alcohol products.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese 50 years have shown that isolation has not worked,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Obama said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time for a new approach.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nHe added that he shared the commitment to freedom for Cuba. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe question is how we uphold that commitment,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not believe we can keep doing the same thing for over five decades and expect a different result.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'Special Counsel Robert Mueller is expected to issue findings on core aspects of his Russia probe soon after the November midterm elections as he faces intensifying pressure to produce more indictments or shut down his investigation, according to two U.S. officials.\\nSpecifically, Mueller is close to rendering judgment on two of the most explosive aspects of his inquiry: whether there were clear incidents of collusion between Russia and Donald Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2016 campaign, and whether the president took any actions that constitute obstruction of justice, according to one of the officials, who asked not to be identified speaking about the investigation.\\nThat doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily mean Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s findings would be made public if he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t secure unsealed indictments. The regulations governing Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probe stipulate that he can present his findings only to his boss, who is currently Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The regulations give a special counsel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supervisor some discretion in deciding what is relayed to Congress and what is publicly released.\\nThe question of timing is critical. Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be concluded ahead of the Nov. 6 midterm elections, when Democrats hope to take control of the House and end Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one-party hold on Washington.\\nBut this timeline also raises questions about the future of the probe itself. Trump has signaled he may replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions after the election, a move that could bring in a new boss for Mueller. Rosenstein also might resign or be fired by Trump after the election.\\nRosenstein has made it clear that he wants Mueller to wrap up the investigation as expeditiously as possible, another U.S. official said. The officials gave no indications about the details of Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conclusions. Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office declined to comment for this story.\\nWith three weeks to go before the midterm elections, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unlikely Mueller will take any overt action that could be turned into a campaign issue. Justice Department guidelines say prosecutors should avoid any major steps close to an election that could be seen as influencing the outcome.\\nMueller is expected to make known the probe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s findings soon after the midterms. Bloomberg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Jodi Schneider reports.\\nThat suggests the days and weeks immediately after the Nov. 6 election may be the most pivotal time since Mueller took over the Russia investigation almost a year and a half ago. So far, Mueller has secured more than two dozen indictments or guilty pleas.\\nRead More: Ex-Trump Fixer Cohen Said to Have Lengthy Talks With Mueller\\nTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s frustration with the probe, which he routinely derides as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwitch hunt,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d has been growing, prompting concerns in Congress he may try to shut down or curtail Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work at some point.\\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no indication, though, that Mueller is ready to close up shop, even if he does make some findings, according to former federal prosecutors. Several matters could keep the probe going, such as another significant prosecution or new lines of inquiry. And because Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s investigation has been proceeding quietly, out of the public eye, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible there have been other major developments behind the scenes.\\nMueller only recently submitted written questions to Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lawyers regarding potential collusion with Russia, and his team hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t yet ruled out seeking an interview with the president, according to one of the U.S. officials. If Trump refused an interview request, Mueller could face the complicated question of whether to seek a grand jury subpoena of the president. The Justice Department has a standing policy that a sitting president can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be indicted.\\nAt the same time, Mueller is tying down some loose ends. Four of his 17 prosecutors have left the special counsel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office in recent months. Three are going back to their previous Justice Department jobs, and the fourth has become a research fellow at Columbia Law School.\\nAfter several postponements, Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team has agreed to a sentencing date for Michael Flynn, Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s former national security adviser, who pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements last year. The Dec. 18 date comes more than a year after Mueller secured a cooperation deal with Flynn, suggesting that Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team has all it needs from him.\\nTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, struck his own cooperation agreement with Mueller last month, after being convicted at trial in Virginia on eight counts of bank fraud, filing false tax returns and failure to file a foreign bank account. The plea agreement let him avoid a second trial in Washington.

Those Obama-era rules prevented ISPs from blocking or slowing legal traffic, or from being paid for prioritized, faster delivery.\\nSince Pai\\'s passage of the Restoring Internet Freedom order, supporters of net neutrality have taken several approaches to prevent the new rules from going into effect. More than 20 states have sued the FCC, and several governors have passed executive orders requiring ISPs doing business with their states to uphold net neutrality.\\nSome Congressional Democrats are seeking a repeal of their own, the overturning of the 2017 order that ends the 2015 rules.

His approval would be highly unlikely since Trump had called the Obama-era rules a \"power grab.\"\\nStill, supporters have hoped to force a public vote on the issue, because with midterm elections looming some lawmakers might be swayed as net neutrality is a resonant issue with voters.\\nMore: Senate votes for net neutrality return, but major hurdles remain\\nMore: It\\'s finally happening: Net neutrality rules that sparked intense debate to end next month' target:0\n",

Jesse L. Jackson Sr., and was once widely expected to outshine him.\\nMr. Jackson, 47, has been treated for bipolar disorder, and cited ill health as his reason for leaving. He also acknowledged in a resignation letter a continuing federal criminal investigation into the possible misuse of campaign funds and said, for the first time publicly, that he was cooperating with investigators.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor 17 years I have given 100 percent of my time, energy and life to public service,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Jackson, a Democrat, wrote in the letter to Speaker John A. Boehner. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHowever, over the past several months, as my health has deteriorated, my ability to serve the constituents of my district has continued to diminish. Against the recommendations of my doctors, I had hoped and tried to return to Washington and continue working on the issues that matter most to the people of the Second District. I know now that will not be possible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe timing of the resignation \\xe2\\x80\\x94 15 days after voters re-elected Mr. Jackson a 10th time to represent a district on Chicago\\xe2\\x80\\x99s South Side and southern suburbs \\xe2\\x80\\x94 irked some here, who thought he should have made a decision before Election Day, rather than creating the need for a special election to replace him.\\nAround the nation, Mr. Jackson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s colleagues in Congress and in his own offices expressed sadness over his departure, but few seemed truly surprised. Mr. Jackson, who was once spoken of as a future candidate for the Senate or for mayor of Chicago or even president, disappeared from public view in June, seeking medical treatment in Minnesota and Arizona.\\nBy this month, some leaders in Chicago, including Mayor Rahm Emanuel, had publicly suggested that Mr. Jackson needed to address his constituents, one way or another. Even on Wednesday, there was no official announcement of the resignation, only the letter. Mr. Jackson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s whereabouts was undisclosed. He did make private phone calls on Wednesday to tell some colleagues of his decision, and several described those talks as sorrowful. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe sounded in so much pain,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Representative Bobby L. Rush of Illinois said.\\nStill looming is the criminal inquiry into Mr. Jackson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use of campaign funds.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am aware of the ongoing federal investigation into my activities and I am doing my best to address the situation responsibly, cooperate with investigators and accept responsibility for my mistakes, for they are my mistakes and mine alone,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Jackson wrote in his letter. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNone of us is immune from our share of shortcomings or human frailties and I pray that I will be remembered for what I did right.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWhile Mr. Jackson did not cite the investigation as a reason for his departure, legal experts said his resignation might help lawyers argue for leniency, given that he has already paid a significant penalty: his job. A statement issued by his lawyers, including Dan K. Webb, a former United States attorney from Chicago, suggested that talks with prosecutors were under way. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe hope to negotiate a fair resolution of the matter, but the process could take several months,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the lawyers said.\\nGov. Pat Quinn of Illinois pledged to set a date for a special election swiftly. By law it must take place within 115 days of that date. Already, numerous people appeared to be eyeing the seat. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEvery other African-American politician I talk to on the South Side is thinking about running,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Laura Washington, a political analyst here.\\nSome in Chicago have suggested that another member of the Jackson family \\xe2\\x80\\x94 perhaps Mr. Jackson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wife, Sandi, an alderman, or Mr. Jackson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brother, Jonathan \\xe2\\x80\\x94 may seek the job, but that remained uncertain on Wednesday. A spokesman for Mr. Jackson and his father did not return phone calls.\\nColleagues praised Mr. Jackson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tenure, noting his efforts to build a third airport in the Chicago area, his success in bringing nearly a billion dollars for projects in his district and his drive for an increase in the minimum wage.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHis service in Congress was marked by his eloquent advocacy for his constituents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 views and interests,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, said in a written statement.\\nEven before Mr. Jackson took a medical leave from Congress in June, his political star had fallen. In late 2008, he sought an appointment to fill the Senate seat that was being vacated by Barack Obama. As part of an inquiry into actions by former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois, now in prison for trying to sell that appointment, authorities said they learned that a friend of Mr. Jackson had offered campaign contributions to the governor if Mr. Jackson got the Senate job. A House ethics investigation opened, though Mr. Jackson denied wrongdoing.\\nOn Nov. 6, Mr. Jackson won 63 percent of the vote in his Democratic-leaning district, though he had held no campaign appearances for months and was undergoing treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota on Election Day.\\nNo victory party was held. Instead, Mr. Jackson spoke optimistically of his return to Congress in a statement.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnce the doctors approve my return to work, I will continue to be the progressive fighter you have known for years,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d his statement read. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy family and I are grateful for your many heartfelt prayers and kind thoughts.

It was not clear if the killings were related to the probe.\\nMoreover, it said that people linked with various al Qaeda-related groups in North Africa and elsewhere participated in the September 11, 2012, attack, but investigators haven\\'t been able to determine whether any one group was in command.\\nThe report placed some blame for the outcome on the State Department, saying it should have \"increased its security posture more significantly\" in Libya\\'s second-largest city because of general warnings that U.S. personnel were at risk.\\nThe intelligence community \"provided ample strategic warning\" that Americans and U.S. facilities were in danger, though it didn\\'t offer a single warning that would have predicted the Benghazi attack that killed U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, the report said.\\nBut the findings didn\\'t spare the intelligence community, saying it might have flagged potential threats to the compound had it done more analysis of \"extremist-affiliated social media.\"\\nIt also blasted U.S. intelligence for inaccurately reporting -- without \"sufficient intelligence to corroborate it\" -- that a protest might have led to the attack.\\nThe report said the intelligence community took too long to correct the erroneous reports, \"which caused confusion and influenced the public statements of policymakers.\"\\nThe Obama administration initially believed the armed assault was triggered by outrage over a U.S.-produced anti-Muslim film. It has since classified it as an organized terror attack.\\nInvestigators haven\\'t found evidence of pre-planning and suggest at least part of the attack was \"opportunistic.\"\\nThat suggests a vulnerability for diplomatic facilities, because attacks can happen with little warning, the report said.\\nQuestions around security and intelligence as well as the slow-to-evolve and changing explanation fueled a ferocious response from Republicans in Congress, who have sharply criticized the administration and continue to investigate.\\nNew York Times report casts doubt on al Qaeda involvement in Benghazi\\nA State Department spokeswoman, Marie Harf, said the report largely affirms the findings of an independent review of the Benghazi matter that recommended steps -- since undertaken by the agency -- to improve security at diplomatic facilities worldwide.\\nOn the issue of whether the attacks were preventable, Harf noted that \"we have repeatedly said there was no specific threat\" pointing to an attack.\\n\"Obviously, we\\'ve talked at length about the fact that we knew there were extremists and terrorists operating in Libya and in Benghazi. But, again, we had no specific information indicating a threat an attack was coming,\" she said.\\nThe Intelligence Committee report follows the release on Monday of previously classified information by the House Armed Services Committee.\\nAccording to the documents, senior military officials told the panel there were no discussions related to any specific threat in Libya despite general warnings about the possibility of terror attacks around the anniversary of 9/11. As a result, additional military assets were not deployed to the area.\\nOn the investigation, the FBI was quoted in the report as saying the 15 deaths have severely hampered its probe.\\n\"The FBI\\'s investigation into the individuals responsible for the Benghazi attacks has been hampered by inadequate cooperation and a lack of capacity by foreign governments to hold these perpetrators accountable, making the pursuit of justice for the attacks slow and insufficient,\" the report said.\\n\"As a result, key information gaps remain about the potential foreknowledge and complicity of Libyan militia groups and security forces, the level of pre-planning for the attacks, the perpetrators and their involvement in other terrorist activities and the motivation for the attacks.\"\\nSeveral Intelligence Committee Republicans issued a separate set of conclusions.\\nCommittee Vice Chairman Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Marco Rubio of Florida, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, and Dan Coats of Indiana said failures that led to the attack could be partly related to Obama\\'s failure, in their words, to establish a clear detention policy for terror suspects that gets the most out of intelligence collection.\\nInstead of sending terror suspects directly to the military facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the administration has temporarily interrogated suspects on Navy ships, sometimes for weeks at a time, before sending them to the United States for trial.\\n\"President Obama and his administration must end their efforts to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay and must develop a clear, cogent policy for the detention and interrogation of suspected terrorists,\" the Senators wrote.\\nGOP Rep: Benghazi not a \\'complete cover-up\\'' target:-1\n",

He held forth on national television about his friendships with Howard Stern and Michael Jackson.\\nAll that may have cost him some support: Exit polls showed late-deciding voters were more likely to back other candidates. But Mr. Trump still finished 10 percentage points ahead of his nearest rivals.\\nRepublicans have been frustrated by Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s seeming imperviousness to the usual rules of politics. But after he blundered and blustered his way to victory in South Carolina, it is clearer than ever: Nothing short of a broad onslaught is likely to derail him.\\nSenator Marco Rubio of Florida has long declined to go after Mr. Trump, and he did not shift into attack mode on Saturday. But he drew an implicit contrast with the man who has defined the Republican race with his heated language about immigration and Islamic terrorism.\\nStanding with Ms. Haley, who is of Indian descent, and Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, who is black, Mr. Rubio sketched a tableau of the Republican Party as he might represent it. He promised to lead a conservative movement made up of the children of immigrants and single parents.\\nIt is unclear whether his vision for the party is one that its activist base, enamored so far of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Mr. Rubio, will embrace.

And he lost.\\nIn South Carolina, more than half the Democratic electorate is African-American. Mr. Sanders still expresses confidence that his tirades against Wall Street and the campaign finance system will resonate with those voters. But he is planning to campaign in Massachusetts and Virginia next week.\\nBy only campaigning part-time in South Carolina and not honing his message to black voters, Mr. Sanders risks being seen as writing off a core constituency of the Democratic Party and narrowing in his appeal at a time when a leading candidate ordinarily would be trying to grow his base of support.' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'Economists surveyed by CNNMoney were expecting an increase of 190,000 jobs. The unemployment rate slipped to 7.6%, according to a Labor Department report released Friday.\\nExperts had expected the jobless rate to remain at 7.7%. But the decline is not good news: It\\'s because nearly 500,000 people dropped out of the labor market.\\nNo need to panic. Still, the report left economists cautioning not to read too much into one month\\'s numbers. While the dour news was unexpected and has tempered some economists\\' views on the labor market\\'s health, many still expect hiring to continue at a steady clip for the rest of the year.\\n\"Payrolls can be very volatile from month to month,\" said Jim O\\'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, who thinks monthly jobs figures will average around 175,000 for the rest of the year. \"I\\'m not inclined to panic over one 88,000 number.\"\\nInteractive: Sixty seconds of salary\\nLooking at the first quarter, companies expanded payrolls by 168,000 a month, on average, roughly in line with the trend over the past two years. That reflects one of the bright notes in Friday\\'s report: Hiring in January and February was revised upward by 61,000 jobs.\\nEconomists surveyed by CNNMoney earlier this week were forecasting that employers will add 2.24 million jobs over the course of 2013, and that 2.4 million jobs will be added next year.\\nThey also think the unemployment rate will edge down slightly to 7.4% by the end of this year and improve to 6.7% by the end of 2014. That would put it close to the 6.5% level that the Federal Reserve has said it wants to see before considering raising interest rates.\\nAnother spring slump? Experts offered a variety of explanations for the March slowdown, which some fear could be the beginning of another \"spring swoon.\"\\nSome companies may have increased hiring in January and February, hoping for a stronger economic rebound in 2013, but then pulled back in March when sales didn\\'t match expectations, said John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo.\\n\"The slower hiring will certainly make people less optimistic about economic growth going forward,\" said Silvia, who also attributed part of the slowdown to seasonal factors that have dampened job growth each spring since the Great Recession.\\nWhile the impact of the forced federal budget cuts, which began March 1, was a concern, it doesn\\'t appear to have directly affected the March payroll figures much. The federal government, excluding the U.S. Postal Service, shed only 2,200 positions.\\nRelated story: Why the Fed can\\'t help the long-term unemployed\\nBut the cuts are weighing on businesses, said Scot Melland, chief executive of Dice Holdings, a global online recruiter.\\n\"They are still being very cautious about adding workers,\" he said. \"They are still uncomfortable about the future.\"\\nAnother worrisome issue is the nearly half-million people who left the labor force last month. That continues a trend of recent years, said Patrick O\\'Keefe, director of economic research at CohnReznick, an accounting, tax, and advisory firm. The labor force participation rate, which measures how many people are employed or looking for jobs, fell to 63.3% -- its lowest level since May 1979.\\nHe added that if these people are departing the labor force because they have given up looking or aren\\'t even entering the workforce because they are too discouraged, that will weigh on consumer confidence and spending.\\nRetail lags but construction still hot. Last month, hiring was concentrated in fewer industries. Growth was dragged down by the retail sector, which lost 24,000 jobs, and at the U.S. Postal Service, which shed 12,000 positions. The drop in retail was particularly disappointing, considering that the sector had averaged an increase of 32,000 jobs a month for the past six months.\\nConstruction jobs held up though. The sector added 18,000 jobs in March, a pleasant surprise after a report earlier this week from payroll processor ADP showed hiring in construction remained flat.\\nOverall, the private sector added merely 95,000 jobs, while the public sector lost 7,000 jobs.\\nThe lousy monthly jobs data concluded a week of downbeat labor market news. A report Thursday showed that initial unemployment claims jumped 28,000 for the week ending March 30. On Wednesday, ADP said that private sector hiring had slowed in March.\\nInvestors did not like the report either. Stocks fell Friday on the news.' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'The labor market slowed in December as U.S. employers added 148,000 jobs in a sign that worker shortages may crimp hiring in 2018.\\nThe unemployment rate, which is calculated from a different survey, was unchanged at 4.1%, the Labor Department said Friday.\\nMore: Minimum wage hikes: 18 states, 20 cities to lift pay floors Jan. 1\\nMore: Worker-friendly rule overturned by NLRB\\nMore: Will the economy bust out in 2018?\\nThe report provides the first unvarnished glimpse of hiring in several months. Average job growth topped 200,000 in October and November but economists attributed much of the increase to a bounce-back after hurricanes in Texas and Florida kept workers at home and suppressed September payrolls. The unemployment rate, a 17-year low, has spawned a tight market that may continue to scale back employment growth.\\n\"The challenge in 2018 will be how to continue to add jobs when there are fewer people looking for them,\" says James Marple, senior economist for TD Economics.\\nLast month, average hourly wages rose 9 cents to $26.63, nudging the annual increase to 2.5% from 2.4%. Pay gains have been stuck at about 2.5% for well over a year. Economists have expected a bigger spike because of the low unemployment rate that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s making it tougher for employers to find workers.\\nBusinesses added 146,000 jobs. Federal, state and local governments added 2,000.\\nJob gains for October and November were revised down by a total 9,000. October\\xe2\\x80\\x99s was revised to 211,000 from 244,000 and November\\xe2\\x80\\x99s was upgraded to 252,000 from 228,000.\\nA broader unemployment measure that includes discouraged workers and part-timers who prefer full-time jobs, as well as the unemployed, ticked up to 8.1% from 8% but is down from 9.1% a year ago.\\nAt least part of December\\xe2\\x80\\x99s weak performance can be chalked up to 20,000 job losses in retail, which faces upheaval as Americans increasingly shop online. Yet even professional and business services added just 19,000 jobs, far below its typical pace. Healthcare and leisure and hospitality each added 29,000. Mid-December storms played a role in tempering employment, Goldman Sachs said in a research note.\\nConstruction, however, added a relatively robust 30,000 jobs as rebuilding accelerated in the hurricane zones in Texas and Florida. Manufacturing added 25,000 as U.S. factories continue to benefit from an improving global economy and a revival in oil drilling.\\nThe disappointing report probably won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates as soon as March in an effort to head off eventual jump in inflation as low unemployment pushes wages higher, several economists said.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe do not think that today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s employment report will keep the Federal Reserve from (hiking rates again in March) given other strong recent economic data\\xe2\\x80\\xa6and the pickup in wage gains,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says David Berson, Nationwide\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chief economist. The Fed tentatively plans three quarter-point rate hikes this year.\\nFor 2017, monthly job gains averaged 171,000, down from 187,000 in 2016 and 226,000 in 2015. Many economists expect average increases of about 160,000 this year as the low unemployment rate offers employers a smaller pool of available workers. Yet even that more moderate pace would be far more than enough to continue pushing down the jobless rate. And the smaller stock of job candidates should ignite faster wage gains as businesses compete more intensely for applicants.\\nOther economists, however, point to a shadow supply of workers who aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t counted in the official unemployment rate, such as discouraged Americans who stopped looking for jobs but may be lured back into an improving market. That group could keep hiring elevated and temper pay increases well into 2018.\\nOther recent labor market indicators have been encouraging. Payroll processor ADP this week said businesses added 250,000 jobs in December. And surveys of the manufacturing and service sectors continue to show sharp pickups in activity.\\nMany economists believe the economy grew at close to a 3% annual pace during the last three months of the year. That would mark the third straight quarter of advances at or above the sturdy 3% level.' target:0\n",

Half the cuts would be to non-combat military spending while the other half would be to domestic discretionary spending.\\nThe cuts were originally set to begin on Jan. 1, but the White House and congressional Republicans agreed then to a deal that postponed the cuts for two months in hopes that a longer-term agreement could be reached by the end of February.' target:-1\n",

The results of the machine recount will be due by 3 p.m. ET this coming Thursday. The votes in the Senate race between Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican Gov. Rick Scott, and the gubernatorial race between Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis and Democratic mayor of Tallahassee Andrew Gillum, will be recounted. There will also be a recount for the race for agriculture commissioner.\\nElection officials in Miami-Dade County said they launched a \"machine recount\" Saturday evening, meaning they were loading paper ballots into scanning machines. The processing of some 800,000 ballots could take several days, the Associated Press reported.\\nEarlier Saturday, 266 stray ballots from a mail sorting facility in Opa-locka arrived at Miami-Dade&aposs Elections Department, a spokeswoman for the department told the Miami Herald on Saturday evening. But the Opa-locka ballots won&apost be counted because Florida law says that mail-in ballots can be counted only if they arrive by the time that polls close on Election Day, the newspaper reported.\\nMiami-Dade had received some 15,000 mail ballots Tuesday while conventional voters were at the polls, the report said.\\nOn Saturday morning, a group of protesters outside the Miami-Dade agency&aposs offices demanded that all ballots be counted, regardless of when they were received, the Herald reported.\\nIn Florida, a mandatory recount occurs if the winning candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s margin is less than 0.5 percent.

      "features:b'Yesterday marked a year and a week since President Obama signed the No Budget, No Pay Act of 2013, which short-circuited the first debt limit crisis of Obama\\'s second term. It also marked the third time in Obama\\'s second term that the House of Representatives, under GOP leadership, has passed legislation increasing the debt limit without extorting unreciprocated concessions from the president.\\nThe fact that Tuesday\\'s debt limit increase -- valid until March 15 of next year -- was appended to a random bill designating the air route traffic control center in Nashua, N.H., as the \"Patricia Clark Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center\" underscores how frivolous and contrived all of the legislative kabuki surrounding the debt limit has been, and at unknown cost to the economy.\\nObviously the Senate still has to pass the plan in order to avoid calamity at the end of the months, and thanks to filibuster rules at least five Republicans will have to martyr themselves for that to happen.\\nBut the past year has revealed two irreducible facts about the GOP and its weaponization of the debt limit. First, that Republican leaders have no intention of allowing the U.S. government to default on its obligations to creditors; and second, that Republicans\\' oft-repeated claims that clean debt limit increases can\\'t pass the House have always been false -- bluster meant to intimidate Democrats into conceding something, anything, for a debt limit increase and keeping the cycle of brinkmanship alive.\\nWhat has truly upset the cycle is that Republicans have finally learned -- after a couple of failed extortion attempts -- that President Obama and Democrats are serious about de-weaponizing the debt limit. They will not be scared into negotiations. Once that became clear the two above facts have augured for clean debt limit increases, which is what we\\'ve gotten ever since. It\\'s practically a logical certainty.\\nBut as nice and sensible as it would be for Congress to grant the executive unlimited authority to increase the debt limit, or to increase the debt limit until the year 1 billion A.D., the House bill only increases it for a year. Until just a few weeks after the beginning of the 114th Congress.\\nPart of that\\'s just a concession to political realities on the right. By weaponizing the debt limit and creating an expectation of routine hostage taking, Republicans have made it very difficult for themselves to explain to their own primary voters why they\\'ve started increasing it routinely again, as if Obama were George W. Bush or something.\\nSo a year\\'s probably the most we can hope for. But it\\'s just as easy to see this as a hiatus -- a temporary accession to political reality paired with a hope that in March of next year the balance of power will have shifted enough to knock Obama back into negotiations.\\nIf that\\'s the case, the spring of 2015 will be a fraught with danger. Particularly if Republicans flip the Senate.\\nHere\\'s why.\\nUnlike the so-called Boehner rule, which has somewhat nebulously and malleably circumscribed the GOP\\'s ransom demands, Obama\\'s post-2011 refusal to surrender any concessions for a debt limit increase is both consistent and unarbitrary. His position won\\'t change no matter how well or poorly Republicans perform in November because no election outcome short of veto-proof congressional majorities neutralizes the executive branch\\'s role in the lawmaking process. No plausible outcome in November will make it legitimate for the GOP to extort its entire agenda on the threat of tanking the global economy. That is a cardinal fact.\\nHopefully a Republican Party in full control of the Congress would recognize that, recognize that their party will be fully held to account for the consequences of a debt limit breach, and increase it without drama. Ironically the one upside to full GOP control is that they wouldn\\'t be able to shirk responsibility for various crises on to Senate Democrats anymore.\\nBut a GOP sweep in 2014 would also restimulate the right\\'s appetite for confrontation. It wouldn\\'t really matter how contrived or unfeasible their demands were -- they would expect Republicans in Congress to produce. The tension between factions on the right would be much greater than it is right now or at any time last year. And that would create an environment of uncertainty rivaling the summer of 2011.' target:-1\n",

      "features:b'Is there a more unsettling day on the Christian calendar than Palm Sunday? The enduring quietude of Lent suddenly breaks, the somber music gives way to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll Glory, Laud, and Honor,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and we, the agents of Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crucifixion, jubilantly welcome him to the city where he is soon to die, actors caught up in a drama whose ending has already been dictated by history and our own innate sinfulness. The juxtaposition of joy and death is haunting and all too literal in many denominations, where Palm Sunday coincides with Passion Sunday and gospel passages for both are read. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHosanna!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d goes the crowd at ten a.m.; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGive us Barabbas!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d fifteen minutes later. In Catholic churches, the priest enters to songful adulation from the parishioners, while the altar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statues, shrouded in cloth as is Lenten custom, stand in spectral reminder of what is to come.\\nIt is Holy Week, even here in Washington where the pastel vestments have been donned and fastidious preparations made for the sacrament of Bottomless Mimosas Easter Brunch. For those of us who are Christians, this week is characterized by the emotional lurch of Palm Sunday, the foreboding of Maundy Thursday, the horrid realization of Good Friday, the anticipation of Holy Saturday, the euphoria of Easter Sunday. Its observance at the intersection of winter and spring means the weather often coincides with the mood, or at least seems to. I developed an expectation growing up that Good Fridays are always cold and overcast and Easter Sundays are perennially warm and sunny. Rattle off all the temperature data you like, that impression will still linger.\\nBut Holy Week\\xe2\\x80\\x99s manifestation in our lives goes far beyond silly meteorological coincidences. The Ascension elicits creeping doubts, the Beatitudes get consigned to the backwaters of memory, but the narrative of the Passion, with its achingly flawed supporting characters, is urgently relatable. What has Hollywood ever produced that can compare to the vexation of Pontius Pilate, brutal yet tormented, facing down the bleating mob on one side and a man he can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite bring himself to condemn on the other? In the Gospel of Luke, Pilate declares that he finds no guilt in Jesus, then punts the problem to Herod, then announces that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s releasing the prisoner, then appeals to the crowd after they shout him down, then says that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfound no cause of death in him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d then \\xe2\\x80\\x94 only then, after his extensive pleading has made him more sympathetic than the ostensibly pious religious leaders on his doorstep \\xe2\\x80\\x94 does he order the Son of God crucified. In John\\xe2\\x80\\x99s slightly divergent account, Pilate is revealed to be deeply afraid. Who among us wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be?\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t obsess over Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suffering,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d some say. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s his teachings that will convert the masses.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Yet the Passion is Christianity at its most human. Man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quintessential susceptibility to groupthink and the mob both protects Jesus \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the Pharisees repeatedly postpone arresting him for fear of the people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and guarantees his crucifixion. Peter, poor Peter, became the rock for Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Church, but only after the cock\\xe2\\x80\\x99s languorous crow. His excruciating imperfection \\xe2\\x80\\x94 at one point Jesus castigates him as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstumbling block\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 would be cited by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger two millennia later as the reason the Church is only a flawed vessel of God, consisting, as did the Twelve, of mere stumbling men. And if Peter wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the ultimate hero, then neither was Judas the consummate villain, ruing his deliverance of Jesus to the authorities and tossing away his silver, only to repair off to the desert and hang himself.\\nThese narratives weigh on us because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so easy to superimpose ourselves onto the experiences of the apostles. Confronted by a simmering mob, would we, too, have disowned a friend? Would we have stayed awake for a cryptic religious radical? Even Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99s humanity was on full exhibit during the Passion, as he agonized in Gethsemane and later wondered on the cross why he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been forsaken. It can be easy to forget how dark his story was. Christianity is a religion founded on a repurposed torture implement, and much of the worthwhile literature it inspired \\xe2\\x80\\x94 think of the gore-strewn leopards and mysterious ghosts from T.S. Eliot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAsh Wednesday\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 draws upon some very bleak symbolism.\\nI remember watching a documentary about Tony Blair some time ago in which an aide recalled discovering a Bible in the former prime minister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s luggage. Presented with this incriminating evidence, Blair confessed to being a Christian, but was quick to aver that he was a private one and thus not liable to be consigned to a mental hospital. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m slightly exaggerating there and Blair has since become more public about his Christianity, but his initial reticence is the model these days. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made a virtue out of religion being a closed-door matter, if that. Yet for Christians, the humanity of Holy Week makes our faith overlap with the world around us, just as after years of instructing his followers to stay quiet (at least in Mark) Jesus made his triumphant entrance into Jerusalem.\\nIn his poem \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Burden of Itys,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Oscar Wilde writes, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSing louder yet, why must I still behold / The wan white face of that deserted Christ.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wilde was then gravitating towards the paganism that would nearly consume him, yet he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t shake that image, that face of that man.

      "features:b'The Islamic State (ISIS) attacks in Paris have nearly all Americans worried about a terrorist strike in the United States \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and a majority convinced we\\'re at war with radical Islam, according to a new poll. The Washington Post-ABC News survey, finds a stunning 83 percent of registered voters believe a terrorist attack in the United States resulting in large casualties is likely in the near future \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a rise of 10 percentage points from a Quinnipiac University poll taken between Oct. 29 and Nov. 2 asking the same question. A full 40 percent say a major attack is \"very likely,\" matching the level of concern after the 2005 subway bombings in Britain, according to the Washington Post. The survey also shows 59 percent think \"the United States is at war with radical Islam.\" But Americans are deeply disapproving of President Barack Obama\\'s approach to the problem, either, the poll finds. Asked about Obama\\'s handling of the threat of terrors, 40 percent approve, 54 percent disapprove. Asked about his handling of ISIS, a mere 35 percent approved, and a whopping 57 percent disapproved. \"I just think he\\'s just politically correct, doesn\\'t want to ruffle feathers and is not a strong leader,\" Ken Kaas, a heavy-equipment operator in Pottstown, Pa., tells the Post, describing the president\\'s approach as \"horrible.\" He said many GOP presidential candidates are \"stronger, and they seem to be more caring of Americans and our cause, as opposed to trying to appease the world.\" Charles Moore, a retired Weyerhaeuser employee in Pinetown, N.C., who voted twice for Obama, tells the Post he doesn\\'t like that Obama is so dismissive of ordinary Americans\\' concerns about the refugees. \"I don\\'t like what he said about, \\'You\\'re scared of little children, of 3-year-olds.\\' In Vietnam, little children were killing people, little children were blowing people up,\" he tells the Post. \"With all this stuff going on, it\\'s got to really be looked into before we make decisions about letting in refugees. Because we could be hiding our own enemy.\" He\\'s not alone in that sentiment, the poll finds; 54 percent say the United States shouldn\\'t take in refugees from Syria and other parts of the Middle East \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even if they\\'re screened. In other findings, the survey shows: 73 percent think the United States should take part in a military response to the Paris attacks, with 73 in support of increased air strikes \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and a majority 60 percent backing the use of U.S. ground forces. 72 percent say the federal government should investigate possible terrorist threats even if they intrude on personal privacy.

      "features:b'The Trump administration on Monday detailed how it will dole out $6.3 billion in aid to assist farmers stung by retaliatory tariffs \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s already sparking backlash from some sectors where industry leaders say growers won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get their fair share.\\nThe announcement represents the first round of payments \\xe2\\x80\\x94 USDA officials said Monday they will monitor how ongoing trade disputes affect farmers and that a second installment of cash could be provided to address any further losses. USDA has budgeted up to $12 billion for potential distribution.\\nStory Continued Below\\nThe plan unveiled by the Agriculture Department includes $4.7 billion in direct payments to row crop growers, including corn, wheat and cotton, as well as to pork and dairy producers. The vast majority of the direct payments \\xe2\\x80\\x94 some $3.6 billion \\xe2\\x80\\x94 will go to growers of soybeans, America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top agricultural export.\\nSoybeans now fetch $2 less per bushel than they did in March, when President Donald Trump began to slap new tariffs on Chinese exports, setting off a tit-for-tat trade battle that has resulted in billions of dollars of lost value for a crop that earlier this year surpassed corn as America\\'s most widely grown commodity.\\nThe overwhelming share of direct payments that are slated for soy has incensed other agricultural sectors, prompting industry groups to point out that their slice of the pie is not even close to covering losses that their growers have suffered from retaliation brought on by Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aggressive trade tactics.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnfortunately, this plan provides virtually no relief to corn farmers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said North Dakota farmer Kevin Skunes, president of the National Corn Growers Association. Skunes acknowledged that corn growers knew the aid package would not cover all of their losses, but added that the sector is still disappointed because the plan \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdoes not consider the extent of the damage done to corn farmers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWheat growers, dairy producers and some other agricultural sectors fired off statements on Monday that expressed similar frustration.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFarm income is down, and rural America is enduring a prolonged economic downturn,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said wheat farmer Jimmie Musick, president of the National Association of Wheat Growers. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis relief package shows that the administration isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t grasping the tough conditions being faced by farmers. The long-term solution is to end the trade war.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe prominence of soybeans to American agricultural exports \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the oilseed makes up about 60 percent of the $20 billion in American farm goods sent to China each year \\xe2\\x80\\x94 has led to expectations for months that the crop would factor heavily into the aid package. But the way USDA structured the plan means that farmers in Midwestern states like Indiana and Iowa, which backed Trump in 2016, are on track to receive huge sums of cash ahead of the midterm elections in November, while major produce and nut-growing states, like the Democratic stronghold of California, aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in line to receive big checks from the government.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is strong evidence of [Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s] sensitivity to losing support in the Midwest,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Scott Irwin, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois, said last month when USDA first announced broad outlines of the aid package.\\nThe likelihood that Western states are not expected to benefit as much from the aid package, even though they export great quantities of produce, fruits and nuts to China and also have been hammered by retaliatory tariffs, has fueled criticism that the administration is looking to take care of its heartland political base ahead of the election and blunt potential political fallout from its trade policies.\\nJohn Block, who served as Agriculture secretary during the Reagan administration and has helped rally support for Trump within the agricultural community, disagreed that politics is at the root of the plan.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an effort to send a message to rural America and agriculture that we do care,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe know you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re suffering.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nUSDA spokesman Tim Murtaugh argued last week that the rollout was connected to farmers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 harvest times and not to any political calendar. For most row crops, farmers harvest in the fall.\\nControversy surrounding the aid package does not fall squarely along partisan lines. Many farmers, who tend to vote Republican, have argued that they want the Trump administration to broker new deals to expand overseas markets for agricultural goods, not pay producers for getting walloped in the ongoing trade disputes with China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union.\\nAgriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, in a statement on Monday, noted that the assistance is intended to stop the bleeding in agriculture and give Trump time to land new trade deals.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to note all of this could go away tomorrow, if China and the other nations simply correct their behavior,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut in the meantime, the programs we are announcing today buy time for the president to strike long-lasting trade deals to benefit our entire economy.\"\\nFarmers can begin to apply for trade assistance starting on Sept. 4. Perdue went public with that detail shortly after the administration first announced, in late July, that aid would be made available to farmers, but producers now face a quick turnaround before the application window opens.\\nJoseph Glauber, who served as USDA\\'s chief economist during the Obama administration, said it seems clear that the administration is racing against the political clock with the midterms coming up. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get money out, you want to do it as quickly as possible for political purposes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nPerdue, who was tasked by Trump earlier this year with devising the trade aid program, spent most of the early part of the summer saying publicly that more information on the effects of retaliatory tariffs was needed before the department could determine how rates of assistance would be calculated.\\nDoling out billions of dollars in aid to farmers in a matter of months is a complicated task, Glauber and other economists said, particularly because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s difficult to isolate price changes that are directly related to tariffs, as opposed to other factors like weather conditions and supply and demand. But because the payments are also slated to be paid out before most crops are done being harvested, questions have been raised about USDA\\'s method for divvying up funds between growers, given that payments are being based on actual production.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese things always sound easier than they turn out to be,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Glauber added.\\nBy and large, however, frustration among commodity groups outside of the soy universe stems from the fact that USDA\\'s assistance will cover only a fraction of anticipated losses.\\nThe National Corn Growers Association, during a meeting with USDA and White House officials earlier this month, presented an economic analysis showing that prices have dropped by 44 cents a bushel, amounting to an overall hit of more than $6 billion. Under the plan, corn growers will receive payments at a rate of a penny per bushel, amounting to $96 million \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the smallest amount of all planned direct payments.\\nThe National Association of Wheat Growers and U.S. Wheat Associates also gave officials a rough estimate of losses, showing that prices could fall by 75 cents a bushel, resulting in nearly $2.5 billion in losses. Wheat growers will get just over $119 million in direct payments.\\nUnder the plan, in addition to the direct payments, USDA outlined $1.2 billion in purchases of commodities like apples and almonds, to help boost prices. Goods will be redistributed to food banks and other nutrition programs. USDA will also devote $200 million to developing foreign markets for U.S. crops, through efforts such as advertising, participation in trade fairs and market research.\\nPork is slated to be the largest beneficiary of the buy-ups, with a planned purchase of $558 million. Pork, which has been hit by retaliatory tariffs on multiple fronts, also will get the second-highest amount of direct payments, at $290 million.\\nTraditionally, USDA\\'s efforts to buy up commodities to take supply off the market have been unpopular with many growers because the purchases have less of a direct effect on their bottom lines. A long list of other commodities, including apples, dairy, oranges, pistachios and potatoes would also be purchased under the plan.\\nAlmond growers are a prime example of a sector outside of traditional commodities like corn and wheat where growers were feeling shortchanged. USDA said it will likely buy $63 million worth of almonds. California almond farmers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 who grow the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top agricultural export \\xe2\\x80\\x94 had requested additional funding for the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s promotion activities overseas and to have the government cover 100 percent of their crop insurance premiums.\\nCalifornia and Washington lawmakers on both sides of the aisle had already complained about the bailout shortchanging growers in their states \\xe2\\x80\\x94 almond growers included. Last month, a group of California lawmakers wrote to USDA expressing concern about \\xe2\\x80\\x9csolely relying\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on commodity purchases to help farmers who grow tree nuts, like almonds, along with citrus, leafy greens, berries, tree fruit and potatoes \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a category known as specialty crops.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c[A]ny program that is focused on direct payments should be constructed in a way that can also work for the growers of these types of commodities,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they wrote.\\nEarlier this month, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) held a call with the White House Office of Management and Budget, ostensibly to press for more aid for California interests. The call included fellow California GOP Reps. Jeff Denham and David Valadao, and a number of USDA officials, according to a public meeting calendar.\\nPerdue has said, however, that the aid package was not designed to make up for all trade-related losses.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to make everybody whole. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to make everybody happy,\" Perdue said during an appearance at a farm in New York last week.' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'A House committee\\'s report released Friday that exonerates the CIA, the military and Obama administration officials for their response to the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, is \"full of crap,\" South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told CNN Sunday. The latest findings come from a declassified two-year investigation by the House Intelligence Committee, which looked at all sides of the incident, including claims that the White House cooked up phony talking points for then-UN Ambassador Susan Rice. \"I\\'m saying the House Intelligence Committee is doing a lousy job policing their own,\" Graham told CNN correspondent Gloria Borger on the \"State of the Union\" program. \"I\\'m saying that anybody who has followed Benghazi at all knows that the [former] CIA deputy director [Mike Morell] did not come forward to tell Congress what role he played in changing the talking points and the only way we knew he was involved is when he told a representative at the White House, I\\'m going to do a hard review of this, a hard rewrite,\" said Graham. Further, he said, while Morell had initially said the FBI changed the talking points on what had been said about the attacks, a lawsuit later revealed that Morell was more involved than he had admitted. \"Who told [National Security Advisor] Susan Rice that the compound consulate was substantially strong and significantly secured?\" Graham said. \"That wasn\\'t in the talking points, but she said that.\" Graham said there are still too many questions remaining about who was responsible for \"the version most politically beneficial to the administration,\" to accept the report that was released Friday. In a joint statement accompanying the release of the report, Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Mich., and the committee\\'s top Democrat, Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, Md., said its probe was extensive. But Graham countered that the document is a \"bunch of garbage...a complete bunch of garbage,\" with its claims, and that it\\'s a \"good question\" why Rogers, the Republican committee chair would believe statements to the contrary. Further, Graham pointed out reports of an email from earlier this year that showed White House White House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes advising Rice to focus on a YouTube video as the cause of a spontaneous protest when she hit the talk show circuit the Sunday after the attacks. \"When Susan Rice was on television after the attack, she said on three different occasions the consulate was strongly, substantially and significantly secure,\" said Graham Sunday. \"She gave an impression to the American people that these folks were well taken care of when it was in fact a death trap.\" The report also said there is no evidence there was a stand-down order when it came to security for the Benghazi facility, an other point Graham denied Sunday. \"I can tell you that three contractors working for the agency said that they were told to wait for 20 minutes,\" said Graham. \"This report puts all the blame on the State Department and absolves the Intelligence Committee. When the Department of Defense Committee has looked at it, the Department of Defense was held blameless.\" And as a result, Graham said, \"everybody is pointing fingers to everybody else,\" but when the report that came out Friday said here was \"no manipulating of the American people, that is absolute garbage.\" And when the report said there is no evidence that CIA personnel misled Congress, Graham said, \"I don\\'t buy the idea that the agency did not mislead Congress because I was there when they misled me.\"' target:1\n",

      "features:b'Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama\\'s televised address on ISIS on Sunday night was meant to calm the public\\'s escalating fears of terrorism, to chide 2016 candidates about explosive rhetoric over waging war and the place of Muslims in society and to defend his own efforts to combat the extremist group.\\nWhether it succeeded on any of those counts may depend where observers sit on the polarized U.S. political spectrum. But while it was largely a stay-the-course speech rather than one that heralds swift or significant changes to the anti-terrorism approach Obama has pursued throughout his presidency, the President did make several proposals and highlight some evolution in how the United States will go after ISIS in Syria and Iraq.\\nHe notably put the emphasis on Congress to take action on making it more difficult for terrorists to acquire guns in the United States and to enact changes to visa programs in the wake of the San Bernardino attack. Obama also wants lawmakers to finally put the war against ISIS on firm legal footing.\\nHere is a look at the President\\'s proposals -- and the chances that they will actually happen.\\nLegal framework\\nWhat the President said:\\n\"If Congress believes, as I do, that we are at war with ISIL, it should go ahead and vote to authorize the continued use of military force against these terrorists.\"\\nIts prospects:\\nThe United States has spent more than a year pounding ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria from the air. Obama has sent Special Operations forces to Syria and several thousand soldiers are in Iraq. Now, there are plans for the Pentagon to send a specialized expeditionary force to Iraq to target ISIS. But officially, this is an undeclared war.\\nThe administration has cited authorizations that permitted both the war in Iraq and the fight against al Qaeda to justify its actions but has repeatedly called on Congress to update its mandate to reflect the new threat from ISIS.\\nBut it has not yet happened. Why?\\nREAD: Obama: \\'This was an act of terrorism\\'\\nDespite Obama\\'s comments in his address, the White House is not optimistic that Congress will move soon. The administration introduced its proposal in February, hoping to get a jump on the political season. But like much else touching on the war on terror, the presidential and congressional elections in 2016 are now weighing on lawmakers.\\nDemocrats running for re-election are wary of tough votes authorizing a new war that may upset the party\\'s dovish grass roots.\\nRepublicans don\\'t like the President\\'s proposal, but they haven\\'t drafted their own version and punt by saying the administration already claims to have sufficient authority. And there\\'s a dispute over language. The White House request for an AUMF lasting three years included a provision that prevents \"enduring offensive ground combat operations.\"\\nRepublicans, who want a more robust U.S. effort and are wary of tying the hands of a possible future GOP president, rejected such restrictions.\\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Monday that the version of the authorization that the administration sent to Congress earlier this year would \"limit\" the military, so \"it would have to be something different.\"\\nGuns\\nWhat the President said:\\n\"Congress should act to make sure no one on a no-fly list is able to buy a gun ... this is a matter of national security. We also need to make it harder for people to buy powerful assault weapons like the ones that were used in San Bernardino.\"\\nIts prospects:\\nJust as the Newtown massacre and other mass killings did not budge the politics of gun control, the same dynamic applies after San Bernardino -- one reason why Obama is now framing gun control as a matter of \"national security.\"\\nMaking it more difficult for a potential terrorist to buy a gun, in essence, would entail making it more difficult for everyone to buy a gun.\\nThat\\'s why die-hard Second Amendment supporters in both parties are wary of the idea, with many Republicans and Democrats unenthusiastic about a tough vote on guns in an election year -- especially those from rural districts where gun rights are a potent issue for many voters.\\nIn fact, even the day after the San Bernardino killings, the Republican-controlled Senate rejected a bill that would prevent people on a federal terrorism watch list from buying guns.\\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan on Monday told the Wisconsin State Journal in an interview that Obama\\'s no-fly list plan was a \"distraction,\" saying many people ended up on such databases erroneously and risked losing their due process rights, a concern echoed by some 2016 GOP hopefuls.\\nMcCarthy made it clear Monday that Republicans are not inclined to take up the proposal that the President pushed to deny guns to those on the terror watch list used by airlines.\\nSome congressional Republicans want a judge to weigh in on whether someone should be on the list before his or her constitutional right to bear arms is taken away.\\nObama\\'s other gun control efforts have repeatedly hit a brick wall in Congress, and he has frequently expressed frustration at his failure to do more despite ordering a series of executive actions. His efforts to pass an assault weapons ban, for instance, failed in 2013.\\nThe White House is preparing an executive order to expand background checks, given its expectation that nothing will make it through legislatively.\\nBut White House officials say the legal and administrative challenges are difficult to surmount, and that the order is going to take some time to prepare.\\nAnd the President has acknowledged that wielding his own executive power cannot be as effective as action from Congress.\\nVisas\\nWhat the President said:\\n\"We should put in place stronger screening for those who come to America without a visa so that we can take a hard look at whether they\\'ve traveled to war zones.\"\\nObama also said that he had ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and State to review the visa program under which the female terrorist in San Bernardino originally came to this country as a fiancee of a U.S. citizen.\\nIts prospects:\\nThe visa waiver program appears to be one rare area where there is bipartisan agreement on how to act. The Paris attacks especially alarmed U.S. security experts because of the fear that thousands of Europeans have traveled to Syria to fight with ISIS. And if those people have European passports, they don\\'t need a visa to enter the United States, potentially making it possible for ISIS to easily dispatch operatives into the United States.\\nOne measure being considered in the House and likely to get White House support would ensure that nationals of Iraq, Syria, Iran or Sudan, or those who\\'ve visited those countries since 2011, cannot travel to the United States without a visa.\\nREAD: Trump on Obama\\'s speech: \\'Is that all there is?\\'\\nInstead, individuals from designated countries will have to be vetted through a more rigorous process. It requires countries who participate in the visa waiver program to share counterterrorism information or risk being cut out. And it also enhances screening for criminal activity.\\nThe bill is expected to pass with a big bipartisan vote in the House on Tuesday and may be added to broad government spending bills so has a good chance of being signed into law soon.\\nStill, changing the visa waiver program is fraught with diplomatic complications. Visa-free travel to the United States is a prized privilege for many national governments and is strongly supported by the U.S. tourism industry. And changes to the program could also spark reprisals and complications for Americans who travel abroad.\\nIslam and the politics of 2016\\nWhat the President said:\\n\"We cannot turn against one another by letting this fight be defined as a war between America and Islam.\"\\nIts prospects:\\nThis horse is already out of the barn. Several prominent GOP presidential candidates -- Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, for instance -- have declared that America is facing a civilizational war against radical Islam. They have bashed Democrats like Obama and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton for not using similar terminology, arguing it shows they don\\'t comprehend the nature of the threat or prefer to avoid offense rather than accurately delineate the enemy.\\nThe President and his former secretary of state argue that using such terminology stigmatizes every Muslim and actually plays into ISIS\\'s hands by making it seem like a legitimate representative of a great faith.\\nThis is a dispute that will continue up to the 2016 election and beyond.\\nThe regional strategy\\nWhat the President said:\\n\"The threat from terrorism is real, but we will overcome it. We will destroy ISIL and any other organization that tries to harm us.\"\\nIts prospects:\\nIt is not just Congress that Obama sees as frustrating his effort to combat ISIS. The realities of the conflict-torn Middle East, a region festering with sectarian hatred, geopolitical gambits by major nations and a collapse of the political order that has been in place for a century are posing imposing obstacles to U.S. strategy.\\nOn the upside, the President can legitimately claim to have assembled a 65-nation coalition to go after ISIS in a campaign that includes air strikes in Iraq and Syria that have killed thousands of militants, covert intelligence work and an effort to choke the extremist group\\'s financial network.\\nBut there is a glaring reason why Obama has struggled to effectively sell his strategy: It does not seem sufficiently broad, kinetic or aggressive to accomplish the goal around which he built his speech -- the ultimate destruction of ISIS.\\nAnother factor weighing against a big change in strategy is the self imposed limit that Obama has placed on the entire enterprise. He is staying faithful to his refusal to commit U.S. troops to another major Middle East entanglement -- citing the quagmire that developed after the Iraq War.\\nThen, there is the intractable nature of civil wars in Iran and Syria, which have fractured both nations and allowed ISIS to build a vast cross-border terror haven.\\nEven if the air campaign against ISIS in strongholds like Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in Iraq succeeds -- progress may be fleeting without a vast ground force to secure territory, consolidate gains and allow space for the return of administrative politics.\\nBut Western leaders, with Iraq in mind, have little desire or political backing to commit a vast land army.\\nSo they, and 2016 presidential candidates, spend a lot of time calling for regional, Arab and other powers to step into the breach.\\nBut those governments are no more willing or able to thrust their soldiers into the cauldron either. And many have goals in Syria that contradict U.S aspirations, leading to inertia. Then there is the influence of other powers involved in Syria, like Iran and Russia -- which may have common interests in defeating ISIS, but are hardly on the same page as the U.S.\\nStill, the administration says it is encouraged by the increasing role of allies like France and Britain in the military air campaign over Syria since the ISIS rampage on the streets of Paris last month that killed 130 people. But due to the limited capabilities of its partners, Washington will still do most of the heavy lifting in the air campaign.\\nREAD: Rubio defends vote against banning people on watch lists from buying guns\\nThe administration has also touted recent German pledges to ramp up reconnaissance over Syria. But at the same time, Arab partners have stepped back. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are now more focused on combating Houthi rebels in Yemen.\\nThe White House is working with Turkey to seal the remaining 98 kilometers of unsecured border with Syria, an effort that includes both Turkish and Syrian Arab forces hoping to cut the flows of foreign fighters into the Syrian civil war -- and their return to Europe.\\nIn the absence of a continued military campaign from the Sunni Arab states -- which the U.S. would like to see resume -- the White House is hopeful those nations can capitalize on their relationships with opposition forces in Syria.\\nSaudi Arabia is also hosting an upcoming meeting of different opposition groups that the U.S. hopes can help pave the way for their participation in a political transition process that would see the eventual departure of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and a theoretical revival of the Syrian state\\nBut those incremental steps, though significant, are unlikely to paper over the fundamental weaknesses of the anti-ISIS fight.\\nTed Barrett contributed to this report.' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'Pleading for asylum after spilling American secrets, Edward Snowden told Ecuador\\'s government that he fears inhumane treatment or even death if he\\'s handed over to face U.S. espionage charges, Ecuador\\'s foreign minister said Monday.\\nSnowden told Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa that it is \"unlikely that I will have a fair trial or humane treatment\" if handed over to U.S. officials to stand trial, according to a letter from Snowden read by Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino.\\nThe whereabouts of Snowden, the computer contractor who exposed details of the National Security Agency\\'s surveillance programs, were uncertain late Monday. He was last known to be in Moscow, where he landed after a flight from Hong Kong on Sunday.\\nHe had been expected to board a flight to Cuba on Monday, Russia\\'s semiofficial Interfax news agency reported. But CNN journalists on two successive Moscow-to-Havana flights said Snowden did not appear to be in the cabin, while officials at the Russian capital\\'s Sheremetyevo International Airport declined to say whether he was still there.\\nU.S. officials have yanked Snowden\\'s passport, but he left Hong Kong on a \"refugee document of passage\" issued by Ecuador, according to Julian Assange, founder of the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, which is aiding Snowden\\'s efforts to find a safe haven. Assange would say only that the former National Security Agency contractor is \"in a safe place and his spirits are high.\"\\nWhile Patino, speaking at a news conference in Vietnam, said the country has yet to decide on Snowden\\'s asylum request, he questioned whether it was Snowden or the United States that was acting badly in the affair.\\nHe called the surveillance programs revealed by Snowden \"a breach of the rights\" of people around the world.\\n\"We have to ask, who has betrayed who?\" he said.\\nCorrea, meanwhile, took to Twitter to address the issue. \"Rest assured that we will analyze the Snowden case very responsibly and we will make with absolute sovereignty the decision that we believe is most appropriate,\" the president tweeted.\\nHe added, \"A big hug to everyone and happy week.\"\\nSnowden has acknowledged that he leaked classified documents about NSA-run surveillance programs to the Guardian newspaper in Britain and to The Washington Post. The documents revealed the existence of programs that collect records of domestic telephone calls in the United States and monitor the Internet activity of overseas residents. The disclosures shook the U.S. intelligence community and raised questions about whether the NSA is eroding American civil liberties.\\nHe walked away from a six-figure job in Hawaii with the computer consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, an NSA contractor, and went to Hong Kong before the newspapers began publishing stories based on his leak. He told the Guardian that he exposed the surveillance programs because they pose a threat to democracy, but administration officials said the programs are vital to preventing terrorist attacks and are overseen by all three branches of government.\\nA Hong Kong paper, the South China Morning Post, reported Tuesday that Snowden took the job at Booz Allen early this year to \"collect proof\" about the programs before disclosing them to reporters. Snowden told the paper that he intends to release more of the documents he took from the firm.\\n\"If I have time to go through this information, I would like to make it available to journalists in each country to make their own assessment, independent of my bias, as to whether or not the knowledge of U.S. network operations against their people should be published,\" the newspaper quoted Snowden as saying.\\nIn addition to Ecuador, Snowden is asking Iceland and other, unspecified countries to consider granting him asylum, WikiLeaks attorney Michael Ratner told reporters Friday.\\nIceland has not received a formal application from Snowden, the Interior Ministry said Monday.\\nMeanwhile, U.S. officials cast a wide net seeking his return, telling Russia and Latin American countries that they should hand Snowden over should he land on their soil.\\nPresident Barack Obama told reporters Monday that the United States is pursuing all legal channels to bring Snowden back. And White House spokesman Jay Carney said U.S. officials are reaching out to numerous countries in an effort to have Snowden turned over.\\n\"The U.S. is advising these governments that Mr. Snowden is wanted on felony charges and as such should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel other than is necessary to return him here to the United States,\" he said.\\nBut CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the issue now \"is much more of a political and diplomatic matter than it is a legal matter.\"\\n\"In an ordinary case, sure, you need a passport to get around,\" Toobin said. \"But here, where this case is causing increasing embarrassment for the United States, governments that want the United States to be embarrassed are only too happy to waive some of the technical legal rules.\"\\nSecretary of State John Kerry particularly urged Russian authorities to work with the United States, noting that U.S. officials have turned over seven prisoners to Russia in recent years.\\n\"We need to cooperate on this because it\\'s important to the upholding of the rule of law,\" he told CNN.\\nHe defended the U.S. effort to capture Snowden for prosecution, saying \"people may die as a consequence of what this man did.\"\\nFBI Director Robert Mueller called his counterpart at Russia\\'s Federal Security Service twice Monday concerning Snowden, a senior administration official said. And a Justice Department official told CNN that the United States isn\\'t planning to ask for a \"red notice\" calling on members of the international police agency Interpol to take Snowden into custody -- but the official would not say whether the United States has sent or will send provisional arrest warrants to other countries that might take Snowden in or help him in his travels.\\nEcuador \\'analyzing\\' request\\nIt seems unlikely that Cuba, Venezuela or Ecuador -- the nations on Snowden\\'s potential itinerary -- would be inclined to send him back to the United States. The U.S. government has already asked those three Latin American countries to not admit Snowden or to expel him if they do, a senior Obama administration official told CNN on Sunday.\\nBut Cuba and Venezuela have long had strained relations with Washington. And Ecuador has given Assange refuge in its embassy in London for a year after he unsuccessfully fought extradition to Sweden in British courts.\\nWhy would Snowden head for Ecuador?\\nAssange say he fears Sweden, which wants him for questioning about sexual assault allegations, would transfer him to the United States.\\nIn his letter, read by Patino, Snowden compared himself to Pvt. Bradley Manning, the U.S. soldier accused of leaking classified information through WikiLeaks. He said U.S. officials have treated Manning inhumanely by holding him in solitary confinement, and he predicted a similar \"cruel and unusual\" fate for himself if he falls into U.S. hands.\\nCarney questioned Snowden\\'s assertion that he acted in defense of democratic transparency, saying his argument \"is belied by the protectors he has potentially chosen -- China, Russia, Ecuador.\"\\n\"His failures to criticize these regimes suggests that his true motive throughout has been to injure the national security of the United States, not to advance Internet freedom and free speech,\" Carney told reporters.\\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists has criticized Correa\\'s government for pushing legislation that would roll back press freedoms, calling its policies increasingly repressive. But Snowden isn\\'t looking for \"political nirvana,\" said Glenn Greenwald, the columnist for the Guardian who broke Snowden\\'s revelations.\\n\"He\\'s searching for a place where he can be safe and remain free and participate in the debate, and Ecuador seems to be the place he has chosen,\" Greenwald told CNN\\'s The Lead.\\nU.S. warns China\\nCarney said Monday that Hong Kong\\'s decision to let Snowden leave dealt efforts to build trust between the United States and China a \"serious setback.\" He declined to speculate what impact the decision could have on U.S.-China relations, but said U.S. officials are making their displeasure known \"very directly.\"\\nHong Kong\\'s semi-autonomous government said Sunday it declined to act on a U.S. request for a provisional arrest warrant because it needed more information -- and without that information, it said, it had no reason to stop Snowden from boarding his flight to Moscow. Carney said U.S. officials had told Hong Kong authorities that Snowden\\'s passport had been revoked \"in plenty of time to have prohibited travel.\"\\n\"We are just not buying that this was a technical decision by a Hong Kong immigration official,\" Carney said Monday. \"This was a deliberate choice by the government to release a fugitive despite a valid arrest warrant, and that decision unquestionably has a negative impact on the U.S.-China relationship.\"\\nLawmakers say tenuous ties shaken further as Snowden lands in Russia\\nBut an online petition calling on the White House to pardon Snowden passed the key threshold of 100,000 signatures over the weekend and had more than 110,000 early Monday.\\nThe petition describes Snowden as \"a national hero.\"\\nThe White House says it will respond to any petition on its site that gathers more than 100,000 signatures in 30 days.\\nWikiLeaks\\' Assange urges support for Snowden, slams Obama' target:-1\n",

      "features:b'WASHINGTON \\xe2\\x80\\x95 Thirty years ago, in 1986, the Senate Judiciary Committee shot down President Ronald Reagan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nomination of Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III to be a federal judge over allegations he made racist comments and called civil rights groups \\xe2\\x80\\x9cun-American.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d On Friday, President-elect Donald Trump offered Sessions the position of attorney general of the United States.\\nSessions, now a 69-year-old senator from Alabama, would serve as the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top law enforcement official if confirmed by his fellow members of the Senate. Sessions, an early Trump backer, is an immigration hard-liner who has been in the Senate since 1997 and previously served as attorney general for the state of Alabama.\\nBack in the mid-1980s, when Sessions was U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama, Reagan nominated him to become a federal judge. But during the nomination process, allegations emerged that Sessions had called a black attorney \\xe2\\x80\\x9cboy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; that he suggested a white civil rights lawyer was a race traitor; that he joked he liked the Ku Klux Klan until he found out they smoked marijuana; and that he referred to civil rights groups as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cun-American\\xe2\\x80\\x9d organizations trying to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cforce civil rights down the throats of people who were trying to put problems behind them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSenators also pressed Sessions on his failed prosecution of black political activists who were helping elderly black voters with absentee ballots. Sessions brought a case against Albert Turner, who walked behind Martin Luther King Jr. during the march in Selma, Alabama, and Turner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wife. They were found not guilty on all counts.\\nAfter his judicial nomination was defeated, Sessions continued on as U.S. attorney for several years, until the end of the George H.W. Bush administration.\\nTrump said in a statement on Friday that Sessions was a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cworld-class legal mind and considered a truly great Attorney General and U.S. Attorney in the state of Alabama.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump said it was an honor to nominate Sessions to be the top law enforcement official in the United States.\\nSessions said he was \\xe2\\x80\\x9chumbled\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to be nominated by Trump.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy previous 15 years working in the Department of Justice were extraordinarily fulfilling. I love the Department, its people and its mission. I can think of no greater honor than to lead them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sessions said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith the support of my Senate colleagues, I will give all my strength to advance the Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s highest ideals. I enthusiastically embrace President-elect Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vision for \\xe2\\x80\\x98one America,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and his commitment to equal justice under law. I look forward to fulfilling my duties with an unwavering dedication to fairness and impartiality.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) had issued a statement Thursday night that said Sessions had the necessary experience to be the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top law enforcement official.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot only would Jeff bring integrity and immense expertise to the role of Attorney General due to his decades of experience in the legal field and an impressive tenure on the Senate Judiciary Committee, but Jeff has also gained the deep respect of his Senate colleagues for his commitment to upholding the rule of law,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Shelby said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy wife Annette and I are proud of Jeff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s accomplishments and wish him and his wife Mary the very best during this exciting transition.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nomination is already facing heavy opposition from civil rights organizations. Republicans will have control of the Senate 52-48 (including Sessions), so their margin for error is not great. If Sessions doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pick up any Democratic support, he could not afford to lose any Republican backers to maintain the simple majority he needs for confirmation.\\nSen. Patrick Leahy, who voted against Sessions in 1986, said Friday that his Senate colleague deserves \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca full and fair process\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAmerican people deserve to learn about Senator Sessions\\xe2\\x80\\x99 record\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at a hearing. He said he had \\xe2\\x80\\x9csignificant disagreements\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with Sessions on civil rights and voting rights, as well as immigration and criminal justice issues.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Attorney General serves as the chief law enforcement officer in the country. The Attorney General must be independent and fair. The Attorney General must be deeply committed to the rule of law and must ensure that all people are treated equally before the law,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Leahy said in a statement. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis means that he or she is also the chief protector of civil rights and civil liberties for everyone in our Nation. That has never been more important than in this moment, when hate crimes have spiked across the country, especially against Muslim and LGBTQ Americans. And when we have a President-elect who has proposed religious tests, a return to torture, and a deportation force that threatens to remove millions of immigrants.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAs attorney general, Sessions would likely exercise broad influence over U.S. law enforcement, immigration policy and, specifically, how the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s immigration laws are enforced.\\nTrump has repeatedly promised to deport millions of undocumented residents, a position that dovetails with Sessions\\xe2\\x80\\x99 fervent opposition to any immigration reform. Sessions is especially opposed to proposals that could be seen as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpath to citizenship\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for some of the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are currently living and working in the United States.\\nSessions, who attended all-white segregated schools, was named for Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War, and Confederate Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard, who was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinstrumental\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the adoption of the Confederate battle flag. He spoke earlier this year about his regrets about not getting involved in the civil rights movement as a young adult.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs a child and a teenager, I saw evidence of discrimination virtually every day,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sessions said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly I feel like I should have stepped forward more and been a leader and a more positive force in the great events that were occurring.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut by the time Sessions was a top federal prosecutor, he apparently thought civil rights progress had gone far enough, as he explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1986. Sessions had been asked to explain why he had reportedly used phrases like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cun-American\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to describe groups like the ACLU and NAACP.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI made the comment that the fundamental legal barriers to minorities had been knocked down, and that in many areas blacks dominate the political area, and that when the civil rights organizations or the ACLU participate in asking for things beyond what they are justified in asking, they do more harm than good,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sessions testified.\\nSessions\\xe2\\x80\\x99 name has emerged as the Department of Justice begins working with the Trump transition team.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Justice Department is now in contact with the President-elect\\xe2\\x80\\x99s transition representatives and will begin to brief those individuals.

      "features:b'A doctor in New York City who recently returned from treating Ebola patients in Guinea became the first person in the city to test positive for the virus Thursday, setting off a search for anyone who might have come into contact with him.\\nThe doctor, Craig Spencer, was rushed to Bellevue Hospital Center and placed in isolation at the same time as investigators sought to retrace every step he had taken over the past several days.\\nAt least three people he had contact with in recent days have been placed in isolation. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which dispatched a team to New York, is conducting its own test to confirm the positive test on Thursday, which was performed by a city lab.\\nWhile officials have said they expected isolated cases of the disease to arrive in New York eventually, and had been preparing for this moment for months, the first case highlighted the challenges involved in containing the virus, especially in a crowded metropolis. Dr. Spencer, 33, had traveled on the A and L subway lines Wednesday night, visited a bowling alley in Williamsburg, and then took a taxi back to Manhattan.\\nThe next morning, he reported having a fever, raising questions about his health while he was out in public. The authorities have interviewed Dr. Spencer several times and are also looking at information from his credit cards and MetroCard to determine his movements.\\nHealth officials initially said that Dr. Spencer had a 103-degree fever when he reported his symptoms to authorities at around 11 a.m. on Thursday. But on Friday, health officials said that was incorrect and that Dr. Spencer reported having a 100.3-degree fever. They said the mistake was because of a transcription error.\\nPeople infected with Ebola cannot spread the disease until they begin to display symptoms, and it cannot be spread through the air. As people become sicker, the viral load in the body builds, and they become increasingly contagious.\\nMayor Bill de Blasio, speaking at a news conference at Bellevue on Thursday night, sought to reassure New Yorkers that there was no reason to be alarmed.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBeing on the same subway car or living near a person with Ebola does not in itself put someone at risk,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nDr. Spencer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work in Africa and the timing of the onset of his symptoms led health officials to dispatch disease detectives, who \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimmediately began to actively trace all of the patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contacts to identify anyone who may be at potential risk,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d according to a statement released by the health department.\\nDr. Spencer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fianc\\xc3\\xa9e has also been quarantined at Bellevue. Two other friends, who had contact with him on Tuesday and Wednesday, have been told by the authorities that they too will be quarantined but whether they will isolate themselves in their homes or be relocated was still under discussion, according to a person briefed on the investigation. None of the three were showing signs of illness.\\nThe driver of the taxi, arranged through the online service Uber, did not have direct contact with Dr. Spencer and was not considered to be at risk, officials said.\\nSpeaking at the news conference, city officials said that while they were still investigating, they did not believe Dr. Spencer was symptomatic while he traveled around the city on Wednesday and therefore had not posed a risk to the public.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe did not have a stage of disease that creates a risk of contagiousness on the subway,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Mary Bassett, the city health commissioner, said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe consider it extremely unlikely, the probability being close to nil, that there will be any problem related to his taking the subway system.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nStill, out of an abundance of caution, officials said, the bowling alley in Williamsburg that he visited, the Gutter, was closed on Thursday night, and a scheduled concert there, part of the CMJ music festival, was canceled. Health workers were scheduled to visit the alley on Friday.\\nAt Dr. Spencer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s apartment building, his home was sealed off and workers distributed informational fliers about the disease.\\nDr. Spencer had been working with Doctors Without Borders in Guinea treating Ebola patients, and completed his work on Oct. 12, Dr. Bassett said. He flew out of the country on Oct. 14, traveling via Europe, and arrived in New York on Oct. 17.\\nSince returning, he had been taking his temperature twice a day, Dr. Bassett said.\\nHe told the authorities that he did not believe the protective gear he wore while working with Ebola patients had been breached but had been monitoring his own health.\\nDoctors Without Borders, in a statement, said it provides guidelines for its staff members to follow when they return from Ebola assignments, but did not elaborate on the protocols.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe individual engaged in regular health monitoring and reported this development immediately,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the group said in a statement.\\nDr. Spencer began to feel sluggish on Tuesday but did not develop a fever until Thursday morning, he told the authorities. At 11 a.m., he found that he had a 100.3-degree temperature and alerted the staff of Doctors Without Borders, according to the official.\\nThe staff called the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s health department, which in turn called the Fire Department.\\nEmergency medical workers, wearing full personal protective gear, rushed to Dr. Spencer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s apartment, on West 147th Street. He was transported to Bellevue and arrived shortly after 1 p.m.\\nHe was placed in a special isolation unit and is being seen by the designated medical critical care team. Team members wear personal protective equipment with undergarment air ventilation systems.\\nBellevue doctors have been preparing to deal with an Ebola patient with numerous drills and tests as well as actual treatment of suspected cases that turned out to be false alarms.\\nA health care worker at the hospital said that Dr. Spencer seemed very sick, and it was unclear to the medical staff why he had not gone to the hospital earlier, since his fever was high.\\nDr. Spencer is a fellow of international emergency medicine at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, and an instructor in clinical medicine at Columbia University.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is a committed and responsible physician who always puts his patients first,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the hospital said in a statement. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe has not been to work at our hospital and has not seen any patients at our hospital since his return from overseas.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBefore Thursday, more than 30 people had gone to city hospitals and raised suspicions of Ebola, but in all those cases health workers were able to rule out the virus without performing blood tests.\\nWhile the city has stepped up its laboratory capacity so it can get test results within four to six hours, the precautions required when drawing blood and treating a person possibly sick with Ebola meant that it took until late in the evening to confirm Dr. Spencer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s diagnosis.\\nDoctors said that even before the results came in, it seemed likely that he had been infected. Symptoms usually occur within eight to 10 days of infection. Dr. Spencer stopped working with Ebola patients 11 days ago and returned home six days ago.\\nEbola is transmitted through bodily fluids and secretions, including blood, mucus, feces and vomit.\\nBecause of its high mortality rate \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Ebola kills more than half the people it infects \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the disease spreads fear along with infection.\\nThe authorities have been on high alert ever since Thomas Eric Duncan traveled to the United States in September from Liberia, and was later given a diagnosis of Ebola.\\nMr. Duncan died at a Dallas hospital this month.\\nSeveral days after his death, a nurse who helped care for Mr. Duncan learned she had Ebola. Two nurses who treated Mr. Duncan fell ill, but are recovering.\\nThat single case led to hundreds of people being quarantined or being asked to remain isolated from the general public.\\nThe missteps by both local and federal authorities in handling the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first Ebola case raised questions about the ability of health care workers to safely treat those with the disease.\\nIn the New York City region, hospitals and emergency workers have been preparing for the appearance of the virus for months.\\nDr. Irwin Redlener, the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University and a special adviser to Mayor de Blasio, said that the risk to the general public was minimal, but depended on the city moving swiftly.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNew York has mobilized not only a world-class health department, but has full engagement of many other agencies that need to be on the response team,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.' target:-1\n",

      "features:b'WASHINGTON \\xe2\\x80\\x94 President Trump had a few things to say to start the new year.\\nAbout walls. About wheels. About death and sand. About Mitt Romney and Iran. About his popularity in Europe and within the Republican Party. About essentially firing Jim Mattis as defense secretary, and forcing the retiring senators Bob Corker and Jeff Flake from office. And about validation from Kanye West and how his generals were \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbetter looking than Tom Cruise.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nHe lamented being lonely in the White House over Christmas and New Year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. He had been essentially out of public view for a week, so when he convened his first cabinet meeting of 2019, he seemed to be releasing some pent-up demand to be heard.\\nHere are some takeaways and fact-checks from the 95-minute session on Wednesday.\\nWalls, the president said, are a time-tested effective way to secure a border. Just look at the Vatican, he said. Is that wall, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe biggest wall of them all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d immoral, he asked. (Vatican City has walls, but they do not enclose the entire territory and visitors can easily enter some parts.)\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe United States needs a physical barrier,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, adding that it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cneeds a wall.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Later, though, he said he did not really care if the barrier were called a wall, but wanted only to emphasize that a wall was needed.\\nA wall, he said, would stop the flow of heroin into the country, and it would stop human trafficking. There are \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprobably\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 30 million to 35 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, he speculated, and they cost the government $250 billion, which \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwould pay for the wall.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(Government and independent analyses have estimated there are about 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, and one of the highest estimates for costs of illegal immigration \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a criticized study from an anti-immigration group \\xe2\\x80\\x94 pins the figure at $116 billion. Building a wall would not remove these immigrants from the United States and reduce whatever costs they impose.)\\nAnd, Mr. Trump noted, President Barack Obama built a wall around \\xe2\\x80\\x9chis compound,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d except that is not quite what Mr. Obama did. In any event, Mr. Trump said he did not want to be critical of his predecessor; rather, he wanted to make the point that walls work. Drones and other technology, he argued, had more limited capacity. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know more about drones than anybody,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nThe wall, though, had the advantage of history.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe wheel, the wall, some things never get old,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump said.\\nMr. Romney, the newly elected Republican senator from Utah, announced his presence in Washington by writing an op-ed article in The Washington Post that was a scathing criticism of Mr. Trump. Usually not one to shy from a fight, Mr. Trump was relatively restrained when he talked about Mr. Romney, who was the Republican presidential nominee in 2012.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love him to be a team player, possibly he won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump said. The president noted that he had endorsed Mr. Romney for the Senate, and Mr. Romney, in turn, had praised him \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprofusely.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then Mr. Trump added that Mr. Romney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words might not play well in Utah, where the president said he is extremely popular. (Mr. Trump is probably less popular in Utah than almost any largely Republican state.)\\nHe went on to criticize Mr. Romney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s race against Mr. Obama in 2012, and said that if Mr. Romney had fought Mr. Obama as hard as he has fought him, Mr. Romney might have won. And when asked if he were concerned about a primary challenge from Mr. Romney in 2020, Mr. Trump replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey say I am the most popular president in the history of the Republican Party.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Actually, Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approval rating among Republicans was 88 percent at 701 days into his term, according to Gallup, the same as President George W. Bush at the same point. Over all, Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approval ratings among his own party have largely hovered below Mr. Bush\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.)\\nOne by one, the president called on select cabinet members for their contributions to border security. One by one, they responded by praising their boss.\\nKirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, applauded his leadership on border security. She was followed by the acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, who saluted the president for giving up his Christmas and New Year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s holidays \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhile some members of Congress went on vacation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rick Perry, the energy secretary and a former governor of Texas, also praised the president, saying he had been rebuffed on border security from the Obama administration. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re standing up and saying don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Perry said.\\nNot to be outdone, Vice President Mike Pence noted that he, too, stayed in Washington over the holidays. Then he, too, piled on the compliments: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want to thank you for the strong stand you have taken on border security.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMr. Trump was still stinging from criticism over his decision to withdraw American troops from Syria, lamenting that he was the only person who would get \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbad publicity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for it. One rebuke in particular, from Mr. Mattis, seemed to prompt the president to issue some criticism of his own.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow has he done in Afghanistan? Not good. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not happy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump said, before adding, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish him well. President Obama fired him and, essentially, so did I.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Mr. Mattis resigned in protest, and Mr. Trump initially characterized the retired Marine general\\xe2\\x80\\x99s departure as a retirement.)\\nHe protested that some characterized the withdrawal as aiding Russia, insisting that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not happy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (In fact, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia called Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to withdraw American troops from Syria \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccorrect.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)\\nBesides, he said, Russia learned how costly and fruitless a foreign war can be after \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey went bankrupt fighting in Afghanistan\\xe2\\x80\\x9d even though it had good reason to invade the country \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbecause terrorists were going to Russia.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, beginning a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdecade-long attempt by Moscow to subdue the Afghan civil war and maintain a friendly and socialist government on its border,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d according to the State Department.)\\nMr. Trump then misleadingly claimed that Mr. Obama gave Iran $150 billion and $1.8 billion cash. (The first figure refers to a high estimate of frozen Iranian assets released by the Iran nuclear deal \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not a check cut to Tehran \\xe2\\x80\\x94 while the second refers to a payment of a debt owed to Iran.)\\nUnprompted, the president responded to a recent poll in Europe that Mr. Romney cited in his op-ed article that showed only 16 percent of people in Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Sweden believed that the American president would \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdo the right thing in world affairs,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d down from 84 percent in 2016.\\nMr. Trump took the low number as a measure of how well he is doing in the United States. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I were popular in Europe, I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be doing my job.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nHe later added, though, that he could indeed reverse those numbers. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI could be the most popular person in Europe,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI could run for any office if I wanted to.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMr. Trump seemed to think that some of his predecessors \\xe2\\x80\\x94 he did not name names \\xe2\\x80\\x94 have coasted in what is frequently described as the most difficult, loneliest job in the world.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt would be a lot easier if I just relaxed and enjoyed the presidency like a lot of other people have done,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'With President Obama looking to an unpredictable and gaffe-prone Joseph R. Biden to get his campaign back on track in Thursday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s debate, the pressure on the vice president couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be greater.\\nVice presidential match-ups usually don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the power to change the course of the election, but this year could be different. Mr. Biden is acutely aware that Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dismal performance in his first faceoff with Republican rival Mitt Romney largely erased Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lead in several key battleground states, ratcheting up the stakes for his performance Thursday night at Centre College in Danville, Ky.\\nAs Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s No. 2, Mr. Biden doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the burden of looking presidential, so can bare some teeth and punch hard against Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Mr. Romney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s running mate. But getting too loose and looking angry against Mr. Ryan, a budget expert 27 years his junior, could easily backfire on the vice president, leading him to veer off script and reminding viewers of Sen. John McCain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grumpy 2008 debate performance against Mr. Obama, who remained calm and collected.\\nWith this in mind, Mr. Biden has been assiduously preparing for his prime-time clash with Mr. Ryan. Holed up for much of the week in a hotel in Wilmington, Del., the vice president has been scrutinizing videos of Mr. Ryan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speeches and interviews, and holding mock debates against Rep. Chris Van Hollen, Maryland Democrat, who is playing Mr. Ryan in debate preparation, as well as David Axelrod, a senior adviser in the Obama campaign.\\nMr. Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s frequent gaffes on the campaign trail have given Republicans plenty of campaign fodder, but the vice president seemed keenly focused on trying to keep his tongue in check Thursday.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to say anything in the debate that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not completely accurate,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told reporters late last week.\\nThough Mr. Biden has created a few headaches for Mr. Obama throughout the election, Mr. Biden is a seasoned debate veteran who has run for president twice and delivered a strong performance against then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in 2008.\\nRelatively untested, Mr. Ryan is more of a blank slate. His aides say he has participated in a debate only once \\xe2\\x80\\x94 when he first ran for Congress 14 years ago. Mr. Ryan also has been hunkered down in debate preparation over the past week, spending days at a resort in the Blue Ridge Mountains 150 miles southwest of Washington, where he was joined by former Solicitor General Ted Olson, who played the role of Mr. Biden in mock debates.\\nFour years ago, Mr. Biden approached the debate against Mrs. Palin cautiously, careful not to get too rough with the newcomer to the national stage. But after Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lethargic showing last week, Mr. Biden is expected to come out swinging.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI expect the vice president to come at me like a cannonball,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Ryan told reporters earlier this week. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be in full attack mode, and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll let any inconvenient facts get in his way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIf what Mr. Biden has been saying on the campaign trail is any indication, he will likely try to force Mr. Ryan to defend Mr. Romney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proposals on taxes and spending \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and seize any opportunity to tie Mr. Romney to Mr. Ryan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Medicare plan, which includes caps on future spending and a plan to partially privatize it.\\nJust last week, Mr. Biden and Mr. Ryan sparred over the Democrats\\xe2\\x80\\x99 desire to let the Bush-era tax rates for households making $250,000 and up expire at the end of the year. Even though the call for a tax hike on top earners wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t new, Mr. Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blunt language admitting that he and Mr. Obama want a $1 trillion tax increase gave Mr. Ryan an opportunity to go on the attack.\\nCampaigning in Council Bluffs, Iowa, Mr. Biden said Mr. Romney and other Republicans often say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Obama and Biden want to raise taxes by a trillion dollars.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Guess what? Yes, we do, in one regard: We want to let that trillion-dollar tax cut expire so the middle class doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to bear the burden of all that money going to the super-wealthy. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a tax raise. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called fairness where I come from.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMr. Ryan pounced on the quote at a campaign stop in Virginia last Thursday.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need is a trillion-dollar tax increase,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need is a tax increase on our successful job creators that will cost us 700,000 jobs in just two years.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWhen Mr. Romney picked Mr. Ryan, Medicare became a major issue in the campaign, and Mr. Biden is likely to do everything he can to score points on the topic during the debate.\\nPolls have given Mr. Obama the edge when it comes to handling Medicare. The most recent CNN survey had Mr. Obama leading Romney-Ryan on Medicare, 53 percent to 44 percent, and ABC News had Mr. Obama up 4 points on the issue.\\nIn early September, while campaigning in Mr. Ryan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s home state of Wisconsin, Mr. Biden said the Romney-Ryan ticket would turn Medicare into \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvoucher-care.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are for Medicare. They are for voucher care,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s basic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut Mr. Ryan has not tried to run away from the Medicare issue, memorably joined by his 78-year-old mother, Betty Douglas, when he delivered a speech on Medicare reform in The Villages, Fla., a large retirement community in mid-September.\\nDuring the address, he accused Mr. Obama of siphoning off hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicare to pay for his 2010 health care overhaul.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMedicare should not be a piggy bank for Obamacare,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, reassuring seniors that he is committed to protecting the Medicare guarantee for current seniors and for generations to come.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a line Mr. Romney used repeatedly during last week\\xe2\\x80\\x99s debate against Mr. Obama, pointing out that Mr. Obama is responsible for shifting $716 billion out of Medicare to pay for his health care law.\\nBut after the debate, Democrats said Mr. Ryan protected those cuts in his budget and fact-checkers have deemed the charge that Mr. Obama robbed Medicare of the amount as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmostly false\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a point Mr. Biden will undoubtedly try to hammer home Thursday night.\\nCopyright \\xc2\\xa9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

      "features:b'(CNN) \\\\- Today is the day lawmakers have known about since August 2011: the day those forced federal spending cuts kick in.\\nThis Friday is also a day many never expected would come. After all, the cuts known as sequestration were designed to be so draconian that lawmakers would be forced to compromise and avoid them.\\nBut they haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, and as lawmakers left Washington to begin their weekend on Thursday, so left any prospect of avoiding the cuts that President Barack Obama and his administration have warned will lead to long airport lines and fewer air traffic safety controllers; federal government furloughs and layoffs; cuts to food inspection and border security programs; and education funding decreases that will shut young students out of Head Start programs.\\nFor all of the dire warnings, Obama acknowledged Wednesday that the cuts are \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot a cliff, but it is a tumble downward.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll set the cuts in motion on Friday with a stroke of his pen.\\nHe is required to sign an order enacting the spending cuts by 11:59 p.m. Friday and will do so privately, White House press secretary Jay Carney said Thursday.\\nBefore that happens, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will meet with top congressional leaders: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker John Boehner and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\\nBut Friday is seen by many as too late to reach a deal averting the cuts, especially with Congress out of town for the weekend.\\nAfter Obama signs the order, the Office of Management and Budget will send to Congress a detailed accounting of the cuts \\xe2\\x80\\x93 how much from which agencies and which accounts. Every \"program, project and activity\" has to be trimmed without regard for what it is, according to the OMB.\\nThose who are employed by the government or rely on federal agencies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 spending are expected to feel the effects first. From there, the effects of the sequester will ripple outward across the economy.\\nThe Obama administration has said the law gives them no leeway to spare one budget line at the expense of another, and insiders expect the cuts to be about 9% for nondefense programs and 13% for defense accounts.\\nWhat agencies do have some discretion over is how they roll out the cuts. In some cases, furloughs and other cuts could be backloaded, scheduling them to take effect at a greater rate later in the year in hopes that Congress will reach a deal to replace the sequester that has so far been elusive.\\nOMB sent affected federal agencies a letter on Wednesday reminding them to prepare for the cuts. Some agencies have already given employees their official 30-day notice of upcoming furloughs. Others are expected to follow soon, and budget uncertainty has already caused some agencies to cut back.\\nCongress delayed the cuts from triggering in January at the time of the fiscal cliff. The two month delay from January 1 to March 1, however, made the cuts steeper than the original 5% for nondefense spending and 8% for defense programs.\\nNot everyone is convinced these forced spending cuts are a bad idea.

      "features:b'President Trump\\'s Supreme Court nomiee Brett Kavanaugh was questioned by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday on topics that included same-sex marriage, Roe v. Wade and special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s investigation. Sen. Cory Booker released documents pertaining to Kavanaugh\\'s record that had deemed \"confidential.\"\\nReporting by Emily Tillett, Grace Segers, Ed O\\'Keefe, Kathryn Watson and Caroline Linton\\nThe hearing headed into a closed session around 10:15 p.m., almost 13 hours after it started. They will recovene Friday for the fourth day of hearings.\\n\"I hope a lot of people in this country have formed very positive views of you, as I have,\" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley said as he adjourned the hearing.\\nSen. Richard Blumenthal floowed up on Sen. Kamala Harris\\' questions from Wednesday about if Kavanaugh had spoken to anyone at a the law firm of Mr. Trump\\'s personal attorney, Marc Kasowitz, Kavanaugh said he has learned his friend, Ed McNally, worked at Kasowitz\\'s firm.\\n\"I know Ed McNally used to work at the White House counsel\\'s officeand I now -- I understand that he works at that law firm,\" Kavanaugh said.\\nKavanaugh said he never discussed the Mueller probe with McNally and he is not acquainted with Kasowitz.\\nThe committee took a five minute break at approximately 7:39 p.m.\\nDemocrats are questioning Kavanaugh for a third round of questions after the break. They are each allotted eight minutes.\\nThe committee will then go into closed session.\\nWhen asked by California Sen. Kamala Harris, Kavanaugh declined to say whether he believed that Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage, was correctly decided, employing the precedent of judicial nominee commenting on recent cases.\\nHe also did not comment on family separations at the U.S.-Mexico border, or about the right of the president or Congress to exclude immigrants from entering the country based on race.\\nSen. Thom Tillis thanked all of the police present at the hearing who are required to work 16-hour shifts. The nod warranted bipartisan applause.\\nTillis asked Kavanaugh why he hopes to become the next Supreme Court Justice.\\n\"Public service as a judge is a great honor and it\\'s a great responsibility,\" Kavanaugh said.\\nSen. Booker asked Kavanaugh if character matters for president of the United States and asked him if he respects President Trump.\\nThe senator from New Jersey pointed out that of the original two lists of potential Supreme Court nominees Mr. Trump put out, Kavanaugh was on neither.\\nAt 6:17 p.m., the hearing returned from a 30-minute recess and Sen. Cory Booker began questioning Kavanaugh.\\nAt 5:48 p.m., the hearing went into a 30-minute recess.\\nKavanaugh -- after facing a slew of political questions that he declined to answer throughout the hearing proceedings -- said he doesn\\'t vote.\\n\"I do not vote in political elections,\" Kavanaugh told the senators.\\nKavanaugh, taking questions from Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, clarified that he doesn\\'t believe the president has unlimited powers in war and in matters of national security.\\nKavanaugh\\'s stance on executive power has come into question, particularly since he worked in the George W. Bush White House on Sept. 11, 2001.\\n\"National security is not a blank check for the president,\" Kavanaugh said, adding that \"civil liberties are not silent,\" even in war.\\n\"The law applies even in war time and national security,\" he said.\\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, pressed Kavanaugh as to whether he has ever discussed the special counsel\\'s investigation with anyone in the White House.\\nKavanaugh suggested he had not had any substantive -- or certainly any inappropriate -- conversations about the special counsel\\'s probe with anyone in the White House. But he didn\\'t seem to be able to say he had never discussed the matter -- he said he has discussed questions about the special that might come up in preparation for his testimony.\\nWhite House counsel Don McGahn has been helping Kavanaugh prepare for the hearings.\\nBlumenthal eventually moved on, unsatisfied with the nominee\\'s answers.\\n\"There have to be some limits to executive power,\" retiring Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, said.\\nFlake noted the \"genius\" of the United States\\' system of government is there are constraints -- and checks and balances -- on presidential power.\\nStill, the president has immense powers -- largely because Congress has given up too much, he said. Flake pressed Kavanaugh as to whether he uses Sept. 11, 2001, to justify the need for more authority.\\nKavanaugh\\'s much-discussed basketball teams he has coached showed up to his confirmation hearing in the afternoon, taking seats in the front row. Kavanaugh\\'s coaching of his daughters\\' basketball teams has been much discussed.\\n\"It\\'s awesome to have them all here,\" Kavanaugh said, introducing them to the room one by one.\\n\"They are tough as nails,\" he added.\\nShortly after 3:45 p.m. Grassley called for a brief 15 minute recess in the hearing.\\nRemarking on the landmark Supreme Court case that resulted in a unanimous decision against President Richard Nixon as it related to the Watergate scandal, Kavanaugh called the ruling \"one of the four greatest decisions, and a correct decision.\"\\nThe Supreme Court concluded that while presidents do enjoy a constitutionally protected executive privilege, that the privilege is not absolute. The Court decided that in this case, Nixon\\'s interest in keeping his communications secret was outweighed by the interests of the judiciary.\\nThe Court ordered Nixon to comply with a subpoena and turn over tape recordings he had made in the Oval Office.\\n\"Precendent is important for predictability and stability,\" Kavanaugh said when pressed on his persistent use of the term as grounds for upholding Supreme Court rulings.\\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, asked Kavanaugh if he intended to utilize the Supreme Court\\'s basketball court, located above the chambers and known as the \"Highest Court in the Land.\"\\n\"I do, if fortunate enough to be confirmed...yes indeed,\" said an excited Kavanaugh. Besides his role in the courts, Kavanaugh currently serves as head coach to his daughter\\'s basketball team where he\\'s known as \"Coach K.\"\\nCruz noted the last time the court had been used was by a younger Justice Thomas but was injured during a game with clerks. Kavanaugh said he hoped not to follow the precedent set by Thomas.\\nKavanaugh reiterated to Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse that he has not taken a position on the constitutionality of indicting a sitting president.\\nAsked on Thursday if the president is immune from any and all legal action, civil or criminal, Kavanaugh said that the president has executive authority but is \"not above the law, no one is above the law in the United States.\"\\nOn the issue of recusal, Kavanaugh told Whitehouse that the question of recusal is \"governed by precedent and governed by rules.\" He said that whenever he\\'s encountered a question on the issue of recusal, he\\'s consulted with colleagues on the DC Circuit Court. He later said that he didn\\'t believe it was \"appropriate to make decisions and a recusal is a decision on a case.\"\\nDuring Whitehouse\\'s line of questioning, all vaguely pointing back to President Trump\\'s actions in office, White House Counsel Don McGahn, seated behind Kavanuagh, appeared to be intently listening along and writing his own notes.\\nJust before 2:00 p.m, Kavanaugh returned back to the witness chair for more questions.\\nAt 1:15 p.m. the hearing broke for another brief recess in the proceedings. Senators are expected to take a 30 minute break for lunch and votes.\\nWhile it raised eyebrows, Booker\\'s suggestion that he would be willing to be expelled from the Senate for his release of committee confidential documents isn\\'t rare.\\nAccording to the U.S Senate, since 1789 the body has expelled 15 members. Of that 15, 14 were charged with supporting the Confederacy during the Civil War -- a vastly different charge than what Booker faces.\\nIn other cases, the Senate merely considered expulsion proceedings but either found the given member not guilty or failed to act before that member left office. In those cases, the Senate notes, corruption was the main cause for the expulsion complaint.\\nThe Senate could, however, move to impose a less severe form of punishment known as \"censure.\" A censure doesn\\'t remove a senator from office but the official statement of admonishment or disapproval can have equal lasting damage to an outright expulsion. The Senate has censured only nine members.\\nPromptly at 12:30 p.m., the Kavanaugh hearing resumed. Sen. Durbin takes a moment to thank the U.S. Capitol Police for their efforts to remove rampant protesters, while still commending their freedom of speech.\\nWith a slew of more questions to come, the committee took a break for lunch shortly before 12:15 p.m.\\n\"Circuses are entertaining and you can take children to them, this hearing is neither entertaining nor appropriate for young people,\" Graham argued at the start of his round of questions, citing Democrats\\' grandstanding throughout the confirmation process.\\n\"Most Americans after this process will have a dimmer view of the Senate,\" he added.\\nAsked what would possibly make the confirmation process any better, Kavanaugh thanked members of the committee for taking the time and care in meeting with him the past few weeks, saying they are committed to public service and public good.\\n\"I\\'m in the sunrise side of the mountain and an optimist about the future,\" he added.\\nAsked by Sen. Pat Leahy if 3D-printed guns could be banned without a Second Amendment issue arising, Kavanaugh cited ongoing litigation over the release of blueprints to 3D printed guns as grounds for refusing to answer the question.\\nOn the Russia probe, Kavanaugh denied that he\\'s had \"any inappropriate conversations\" about Special Counsel Robert Mueller\\'s ongoing investigation.\\n\"I don\\'t recall any conversations of that kind with any one at that law firm,\" said Kavanaugh on Thursday.\\nOrrin Hatch\\'s question comes as a second shot to Sen. Kamala Harris\\' question last night during which she pressed the judge if had spoken about Mueller\\'s probe with anyone in President Trump\\'s lawyers\\' office.\\nKavanaugh said on Wednesday \"I didn\\'t know everyone who might work at that law fir, but I haven\\'t had, i don\\'t recall any conversations of that kind.\"\\nAs the hearing proceeded and under the threat of being removed from the Senate, Booker\\'s office went ahead and released the classified confidential documents raised during Thursday morning\\'s session.\\nWhat you do matters.\\nWhat you say matters.\\nNo matter how big the fight\\nOr inevitable the conclusion seems\\nStand up.\\nSpeak up.\\nWrong, temporarily victorious\\nIs never greater than Right, forever vigilant.\\nBooker appeared to tweet on the matter: \"What you do matters. What you say matters. No matter how big the fight. Or inevitable the conclusion seems Stand up. Speak up. Wrong, temporarily victorious Is never greater than Right, forever vigilant.\"\\nIn a document obtained by CBS News from a person familiar with Kavanaugh\\'s confirmation process, Kavanaugh is seen raising doubts about whether Roe v. Wade is indeed \"settled law.\" He wrote the email, first obtained by the New York Times, in 2003 during his time as a White House lawyer.\\nCBS News\\' Ed O\\'Keefe reports that at the time, Kavanaugh was reviewing a draft of a potential op-ed written by supporters of one of George W. Bush\\'s federal appeals court nominees that they hoped would be signed by prominent anti-abortion women activists.\\nThe draft op-ed states that \"it is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land.\"\\nAfter reviewing the draft, Kavanaugh replied in part, \"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so. The point there is in the inferior court point. -- It is hundreds not thousands, I believe, who have obtained bypasses. My 2 cents. Thanks.\" The document does not say, however, whether Kavanaugh personally believes that Roe v. Wade is settled law or should be overturned.\\nKavanaugh in Thursday\\'s hearing attempted to clarify his comments, saying the draft letter was \"referring to views of legal scholars.\"\\n\"My comment was overstating the position of legal scholars, it was not a technically accurate description in the letter,\" he explained.\\nPressed on if he does indeed believe Roe to be considered settled law, Kavanaugh once again reiterated his previous claims that the landmark case is \"important precedent of the Supreme Court, reaffirmed many times.\"\\nRead the email here:\\nGrassley, in a moment of transparency, pressed Kavanaugh on the ability to bring cameras into the Supreme Court to document the proceedings.\\nKavanaugh, not definitively saying where he stands on the issue, said he would \"have an open mind on it\" upon speaking with his colleagues if successfully confirmed.\\nAfter over an hour of Democrats\\' sidelining on documents, Grassley began his round of questioning of Judge Kavanaugh amid the backdrop of the morning\\'s first protester shouting \"SHAME!\"\\nBooker maintained that while he did willingly violate the chair\\'s rule on the committee confidential process, he did so because he \"sincerely believes the public deserves to know this nominee\\'s record.\"\\n\"Bring the charges, go through the Senate process to take on somebody you said is unbecoming to be a Senator, let\\'s go through that process because I think the public should understand that at a moment someone is up for a lifetime appointment...I hope they\\'ll follow through.\"\\nSen. Cornyn: \"I would correct the senator\\'s statement, \\'There is no rule.\\' There is clearly a rule that applies.\"\\nSen. Booker: \"Then apply the rule and bring the charges.\" https://t.co/JUkIdZ4RJ2 pic.twitter.com/yNOK7sRxWm\\nThe Democrat, citing his colleagues support, called the moment his \"I am Spartacus\" moment in the Senate.\\nHe added, \"I\\'m ready to accept the full responsibility for what I have done, the consequences for what I\\'ve done and I stand by the public\\'s right to have access to this document.\"\\nAfter an hour past gaveling in today\\'s session, Kavanaugh has still not answered a single question.\\nAfter threatening to release \"committee confidential\" documents, risking his ouster from the Senate, Booker is admonished by Republican committee members including Cornyn for making such a suggestion.\\n\"Running for president is not an excuse for violating the rules of the Senate,\" said Cornyn, calling his threat \"irresponsible and outrageous.\"\\nThe document pertains to an email from Kavanaugh kept confidential on the issue of racial profiling. Booker maintains the email has \"nothing to do with national security\" and should not have been marked confidential in the first place.\\nDemocrats including Dick Durbin and Mazie Hirono joined in on Booker\\'s plea, saying \"count me in\", decrying the hearing process as having \"broken down\" and accepting a similar fate of possible retribution for the release of documents.\\nGrassley retorted back at the Democrats: \"You want to give up your emails right now? Make them public? I don\\'t think you do!\"\\nDay three began shortly after 9:30 a.m. as Grassley gaveled in Thursday\\'s session. Grassley began the hearing by once again bringing up Democrats\\' concerns over access to individual documents.\\n\"My staff was here until 3:00 a.m. trying to accommodate everyone who requested documents,\" Grassley bemoaned to Sen. Cory Booker over the Democrats\\' complaint that he was unable to ask specific questions without proper access to documents.\\n\"We are holding back not only documents, but not even giving us the time to read those documents,\" said Booker. He called the release of one document the \"tip of the iceberg of all documents that will continue to be released until we have a vote on the senate floor and beyond.\"\\nBooker added, \"I\\'m sure you can understand, sir, how it puts us in a difficult position.\"\\nIn a $600,000 national cable ad buy, the conservative-leaning Judicial Crisis Network urged viewers to tell their Senators to confirm Kavanaugh as their next Supreme Court justice.\\nThe 30-second spot features Kavanaugh \"in his own words\" and will air for two weeks across major cable networks including CNN, MSNBC and Fox News, all of which have been broadcasting portions of Kavanaugh\\'s confirmation hearing.\\n\"If confirmed to the Supreme Court I will keep an open mind in every case. I will always strive to preserve the Constitution of the United States and the American rule of law,\" Kavanaugh is featured saying.\\nJudicial Crisis\\' Chief Counsel and Policy Adviser Carrie Severino said in a statement, \"We\\'re tired of the Democrat carnival. It is time for the American people to meet Judge Kavanaugh for themselves -- here he is in his own words.\"\\nHere\\'s the ad:\\nThursday\\'s line of questioning will involve 20 minute rounds of questions for each committee member in what Chairman Grassley hopes to be the final day of probing of the Supreme Court pick. Members are also expected to get 15 minutes for a third round of questioning if needed.\\nFollowing the day-long session, a closed-door evening session will take place.\\nAccording to the U.S. Capitol Police, officers arrested 73 protesters and charged them with unlawful demonstration activities associate with Wednesday\\'s hearing. Demonstrators spaced out their disruptions throughout the day, forcing committee members to add additional time to their questioning after significant delays. Throughout their shouts, Kavanaugh has remained unaffected and at times stone-faced as protesters demand the hearing to stop.' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'Jesse Benton, campaign manager for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), is resigning his position, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported Friday. The announcement comes as the McConnell campaign wrestles with Benton\\'s possible ties to a bribery scandal when he was political director for then-Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) during the 2012 presidential election.\\nBenton told the Herald-Leader that rumors of his involvement in the scandal \"risk unfairly undermining and becoming a distraction to this re-election campaign,\" referring to McConnell\\'s bid for a sixth term in the Senate.\\nMcConnell reluctantly accepted his departure, Benton told the Herald-Leader, adding, \"This decision breaks my heart, but I know it is the right thing for Mitch, for Kentucky and for the country.\" The resignation was set to take effect Saturday.\\nAs Paul\\'s political director in 2012, Benton has been tied to a scandal that saw thousands of dollars exchanged for political endorsements prior to the Iowa caucuses. On Wednesday, former Iowa state Sen. Kent Sorenson pleaded guilty to charges related to receiving under-the-table payments for switching his support from U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) to Paul. Sorenson then lied to investigators about the payments, according to the Department of Justice. Sorenson\\'s guilty plea was accompanied by two documents that could potentially implicate Benton, the Herald-Leader notes.\\nEarlier on Friday, the McConnell campaign said in a statement, \"Sen. McConnell obviously has nothing to do with the Iowa Presidential Caucus or this investigation so it would be inappropriate for his campaign to comment on this situation,\" the Herald-Leader reports.\\nBenton maintained his innocence, giving a statement to the Herald-Leader that read, \"There have been inaccurate press accounts and unsubstantiated media rumors about me and my role in past campaigns that are politically motivated, unfair and, most importantly, untrue.\"\\n\"Working for Mitch McConnell is one of the great honors of my life,\" Benton said.\\nBenton was hired in 2012 to head McConnell\\'s 2014 re-election campaign and boost the senator\\'s credibility with libertarian factions of the Republican Party. It was seen as a surprising move, one that has caused other troubles for the McConnell campaign. In 2013, a phone recording surfaced in which Benton said that he was holding his nose while working for McConnell and thinking of the long-term best interests of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).\\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly referred to the Lexington Herald-Leader as the Kentucky Herald-Leader. We regret the error.' target:-1\n",

      "features:b'President Obama on Wednesday appointed Joseph P. Clancy, who had guided the Secret Service on an interim basis for the last four and a half months, to be the agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s permanent director.\\nIn picking Mr. Clancy, a former head of Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s security detail, the president rejected calls by critics on Capitol Hill and members of a special Department of Homeland Security panel, who said that a string of embarrassing personnel and security episodes had made it clear that the agency should be run by an outsider.\\nMr. Obama, who has more at stake than anyone in how the Secret Service operates, has told associates that while the agency has had some problems, he does not believe it has widespread problems and needs a complete overhaul. The president was said to be impressed with Mr. Clancy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personnel moves in recent months, including the demotion of several senior officials.\\nMr. Clancy \\xe2\\x80\\x9chas demonstrated that he was willing to conduct a candid, cleareyed assessment of the shortcoming of that agency, and to look at needed reforms and implement them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd that, precisely, is why he has been promoted to this permanent role.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSome Secret Service officials and agents had worried that Mr. Obama was going to choose the other leading candidate for the job: Sean Joyce, a hard-charging former deputy director of the F.B.I. In the Secret Service\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 150-year history, it has always been run by someone who was previously an agent.\\nIn December, a four-person panel created by the Department of Homeland Security released a report that said the Secret Service\\xe2\\x80\\x99s next director should be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cremoved from organizational traditions and personal relationships\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbe able to do the honest, top-to-bottom assessment this will require,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d making it seem unlikely that Mr. Clancy would get the job.\\nAnd in recent weeks, the agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most ardent critic on Capitol Hill, Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah and chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, asserted again that the next director should come from outside the agency. Mr. Chaffetz released a statement Wednesday afternoon criticizing Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe panel made it crystal clear that only a director from outside the agency would meet the needs of the agency today \\xe2\\x80\\x94 someone with a fresh perspective, free from allegiances and without ties to what has consistently been described as a \\xe2\\x80\\x98good-old-boys network,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nLater, Mr. Chaffetz said he was not satisfied that the Secret Service\\xe2\\x80\\x99s problems had been solved and released a joint letter with the committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ranking Democrat, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, saying that the panel would continue its investigation of the agency.\\nAfter leading Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s security detail for much of his first term, Mr. Clancy retired in 2012 to become the head of security at Comcast in Philadelphia. The next year, he told administration officials that he was not interested in being a candidate to fill the vacancy left by the Secret Service\\xe2\\x80\\x99s longtime director, Mark J. Sullivan, who was retiring. But last fall, the president called on Mr. Clancy to run the agency after Julia A. Pierson resigned as director amid criticism of the agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failure to stop a man from entering the White House after he climbed over its fence.\\nAt the time, Mr. Clancy told others he had no interest in becoming the permanent director. But in an interview early in his tenure as interim director, he said that, though he had previously believed the agency might benefit from having an outsider in charge, he had determined after leading it for a short period of time that the learning curve would be too steep for someone who had not been an agent.\\nAs the head of Mr. Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s security detail, Mr. Clancy spent countless hours by the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side, protecting him as he crisscrossed the country and the world. Thousands of photos of Mr. Obama from his first term show Mr. Clancy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face in the background. Along with having a strong trust in Mr. Clancy, who is known as affable, the president is said to like him personally.\\nHis appointment comes at a particularly important time for the Secret Service. This year, along with protecting the first family and senior government officials, it will oversee security for a visit by Pope Francis, the 70th United Nations General Assembly and the beginning of the 2016 presidential campaign.\\nMr. Clancy has significant challenges ahead of him, according to the report produced by the four members of the Department of Homeland Security panel appointed to study the Secret Service after the White House fence jumper made it into the building in September.\\nThe agency, the report said, is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstretched to and, in many cases, beyond its limits,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and needs to hire 85 agents and 200 uniformed officers to properly perform its mission.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps the service\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great strength \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the commitment to its personnel to sacrifice and do the job \\xe2\\x80\\x98no matter what\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 has had unintended consequences,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the report said.\\nMoney that should be spent on new technology systems often goes to pay overtime for overworked agents and officers at the White House, the report said, adding, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRather than sending its agents and officers to training, it keeps them at their posts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn 2013, the average officer received about 25 minutes of training, the report said.\\nThe fence around the White House, which the report said needed to be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cchanged as soon as possible\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to be several feet taller, still has not been altered.\\nAgency officials said that changes to the fence were under review and that they required the approval of several other organizations, like the White House Historical Association and the United States Park Police.' target:-1\n",

Let\\'s get a handle on Medicare.\"\\nFour other priorities for Obama\\'s next four years\\nDeficits, Social Security and Medicare are now carrying over to the second-term agenda. So does immigration. New to the list is a promise to push an assault weapons ban and other gun controls.\\nWhat do all of these have in common? They are issues ripe for confrontations with Republicans, especially at a time the GOP\\'s conservative base is determined to reassert itself.\\nYet that wish list also puts the president at odds, to varying degrees, with members of his own party. Liberals, for example, vow to resist any major Medicare changes. Centrist and conservative Democrats, especially those with tough re-election prospects in 2014, are hardly rushing to embrace new gun controls.\\nInaugural poet: My story is America\\'s\\nNot to mention a varied and unpredictable portfolio of international challenges -- from a volatile Middle East to evolving economic and security challenges in an Asia increasingly defined by China.\\nAnd then there is this: the ticking clock of any president\\'s second term. How long will it take before the lame duck debate begins in earnest?\\nSecond term priorities\\n\"They won\\'t have more than a year, 18 months tops,\" said the veteran Republican strategist Mary Matalin, who in addition to her deep campaign experience served as a top adviser to President George W. Bush and his vice president, Dick Cheney.\\nHer own experience in the second Bush-Cheney term shapes her early take on the political climate as Obama begins his fifth year in office: \"With the six-year itch midterm and a 2016 open primary looming, it will be all positioning all the time.\"\\nAs in the first four years, the strength of the American economy will determine more than anything else how much room the president has to advance his top priorities.\\nA unified voice rises from a divided place: Mr. President, please fix America\\nEducation. Science and technology advances. Critical infrastructure investments. Top Obama adviser David Axelrod lists those as first-term priorities that, in his view, not only carry over to the next four but will shape whether the second Obama term is a success.\\n\"How do we position the American economy for the 21st Century?\" is Axelrod\\'s one sentence take on the president\\'s second-term challenge.\\nA tale of two terms\\nObama\\'s preparations included a recent session with presidential historians to discuss not only the climate he faces, but the historical differences for past presidents given the opportunity to serve a second term.\\nPresident Obama is the fourth of the last five presidents to get a second term. The others - Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush - all had major events that undermined their political standing.\\nFor Reagan it was Iran-Contra. Clinton had the gift of a booming economy, but any thought of making progress on major generational challenges, like Medicare and Social Security, were sidetracked by the Monica Lewsinsky scandal and the impeachment saga.\\nObama in select company\\nBush began his second term with opposition to the Iraq war on the rise, and was further damaged by the deeply held view that his administration failed to properly respond to Hurricane Katrina.\\nTo Matalin, a fierce Republican critic, a major early second-term challenge for Obama will be to change what she sees as a political reflex that has undermined his ability to work with GOP leaders in Congress.\\n\"Second terms exacerbate both strengths and weaknesses,\" she said. \"If you are humility challenged, self-reverential and self-righteous like Obama, you get even more hubris and demonize rather than debate your opponents.\"\\nBiden on Obama at start of second term: \\'In simpatico\\'\\nObama aides bristle at suggestions he is responsible for the trust deficit with the GOP; they say Republicans made a decision very early on in the first term to oppose virtually every Obama initiative. In their view, the burden is on the GOP in term two to show a more cooperative tone and mindset.\\nMatalin also raised an operational challenge for second-term presidents: high turnover in senior positions, from the White House staff to key Cabinet positions.\\n\"Anyone who hasn\\'t left is exhausted,\" she said. \"Anyone who is new is not top drawer.\"\\nObama\\'s second-term priorities' target:-1\n",

Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate, according to multiple reports, including one in the governor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s local paper.\\nA formal announcement is expected to come on Friday in New York City. Though several outlets reported that it was a done deal, The New York Times on Thursday afternoon reported only that there were strong signals Pence was being tapped for the gig. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s communication office has denied that a decision has been made.\\nThe Indianapolis Star reported Pence dropped his re-election bid for governor in order to pursue the vice presidency. His departure from that race means the Indiana Republican State Committee will choose the GOP candidate for governor for the first time in state history.\\nPence, 57, would bring nearly four years of executive experience to the ticket and could help shore up Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credibility among establishment holdouts within the GOP. The governor also seems to have met Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stated preference of a running mate who can ably navigate the corridors of power in Washington \\xe2\\x80\\x95 Pence previously served 12 years in the House of Representatives, including two years as chairman of the House Republican Conference.\\nPence, who twice considered running for president, is well regarded by conservatives and evangelicals around the country, earning plaudits recently from the likes of Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Jeff Roe, former presidential campaign manager to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will admit that I am a Mike Pence fan. He is so well-rounded, served as a governor and I think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great conservative. So I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think he could go wrong,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ernst told Politico recently, after indicating she was not interested in the position herself.\\nOregon GOP delegate Kevin Hoar argued Pence could help Trump with conservatives and the Tea Party wing of the party.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s somebody who would bring along the base of the party, particularly people who might not have been the biggest Trump fans,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hoar told HuffPost outside of an RNC rules committee hearing in Cleveland. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think this would bring a lot of [Texas Sen.

In fact, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very traditional that you have a running mate that may have had a difference in opinion or policy over the years. But you join a ticket to do to things you agree on together. So, if Mr. Trump is comfortable with Pence, sounds like a good deal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nA source who spoke with Trump on Tuesday said he had settled on Pence by then, with the belief that Pence would provide the steadiness needed, and that he would be able to handle the policy substance that is not Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strength. Trump added that he was impressed with the way Pence has run Indiana, and that picking him would lock down the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s electoral votes.\\nLast year, Pence ignited a national controversy by signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, legislation that sought to legalize discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals. After severe backlash from civic and business leaders, however, he was forced amend the measure ensuring protections for sexual orientation and gender identity.\\nBefore Trump even made his pick, he had at least one detractor in prominent conservative radio host and former Red State editor Erick Erickson, who chided Pence on Twitter.\\nTrump picking Mike Pence would be hilarious considering how quickly Pence caved to gay activists 2yrs ago.\\nBy signing on with the Trump campaign, Pence would disqualify himself from running for re-election as governor.

[Attorney General] Sessions met with the ambassador in an official capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which is entirely consistent with his testimony,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the official said.\\nIn a statement to Fox News, the former Alabama Republican senator said, \"I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false.\"\\nWhile Sessions is denying he specifically discussed campaign issues with the Russians, The Washington Post first reported that he did speak twice last year with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. One discussion, in July, was described as involving a group of ambassadors after a Heritage Foundation event on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention. Kislyak was part of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csmall group\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of diplomats who approached Sessions and spoke with him.\\nA subsequent meeting was held in September in the senator\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office. Justice officials said Sessions met with ambassadors in his capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\\nBut while Sessions was serving on the Senate Armed Services panel, he also was a prominent surrogate for then-candidate Donald Trump. And in Senate testimony, Sessions denied contacts with the Russians.\\nAsked by Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., at that hearing what he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d do with evidence that anyone tied to the campaign communicated with Russia last year, Sessions said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI&aposm not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 did not have communications with the Russians, and I&aposm unable to comment on it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe Post noted that Sessions also responded, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in a written answer when asked whether he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been in contact with any part of the Russian government regarding the election.\\nOfficials told the Post Sessions did not consider his discussions relevant and did not recall details of what was discussed with the ambassador from Russia.\\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, speaking with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFox & Friends\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Abby Huntsman, also said Sessions \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdid his job\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as a senator.

FRIDAY\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sessions spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said in a statement. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLast year, the senator had over 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, including the British, Korean, Japanese, Polish, Indian, Chinese, Canadian, Australian, German and Russian ambassadors. He was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign -- not about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAccording to a schedule provided to Fox News, Sessions had 30 meetings with numerous ambassadors from April 14 through Nov. 11. Russia appears on the schedule only once \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the Sept. 8 meeting with Kislyak. The day before, Sessions also took a meeting with Ukraine Ambassador Valeriy Chaly. These meetings took place a week before a seven-day unilateral ceasefire plan was accepted by Russia on behalf of separatist rebels it backed in the conflict with Ukraine.\\nBut for Democrats, the revelations of any Russia discussions only served to fuel long-running accusations that Trump-tied officials have sought to conceal past contacts with Moscow. Earlier this month, Michael Flynn resigned as national security adviser amid accusations he misled Vice President Pence and others over his contact with the Russian ambassador.\\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called Wednesday night for Sessions\\xe2\\x80\\x99 resignation.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJeff Sessions lied under oath during his confirmation hearing before the Senate,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAttorney General Sessions has never had the credibility to oversee the FBI investigation of senior Trump officials\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ties to the Russians.

By pioneering tactics to cut labor costs and avert labor organizing, and instigating imitation among suppliers, subcontractors, competitors and admirers across industries, Wal-Mart is hastening a transformation in U.S. work, toward an ever-more-present future in which workers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 whether fast food cashiers or adjunct professors -- lack living wages, workplace democracy, job security or even legal recognition as employees.\\nFaced with a future of declining leverage and relevance, U.S. unions have taken up a range of tactics on full display in the Wal-Mart effort, including \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccomprehensive campaigns\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that wield political, legal and media weapons against a company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brand, growth ambitions and consumer loyalty; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cminority union\\xe2\\x80\\x9d tactics in which smaller numbers of workers take bold public action to embarrass management and engage more reticent co-workers; organizing in solidarity across supply chains and national borders; short-term strikes designed to maximize public engagement and minimize the risk of retaliatory firings; and working with or through \\xe2\\x80\\x9calt-labor\\xe2\\x80\\x9d groups that aim to transform workplaces without seeking collective bargaining.\\nTogether, these tactics have forged the most serious challenge to Wal-Mart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s control over its U.S. workforce since the company was founded in 1962. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s far outpaced the previous decade\\xe2\\x80\\x99s well-funded but anemic union-backed anti-Wal-Mart efforts, which involved bloggers and presidential candidates but comparatively little in the way of Wal-Mart employees. But the current campaign still faces nearly impossible obstacles, some of which have only become more visible in the year since 400-some strikers and thousands of supporters pulled off Black Friday 2012.\\nChief among the challenges is this: While U.S. law generally bans companies from punishing workers for organizing (whether toward unionization or as part of a non-union effort like OUR Walmart), it does precious little to avert or avenge such retaliation when companies are dead set on maintaining control. In the months after 100-some strikers staged a several-day work stoppage and protest caravan to Wal-Mart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s June 2013 shareholder meeting, 23 of them were fired \\xe2\\x80\\x93 exactly the scenario that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kept many Wal-Mart workers on the sidelines. While \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not think I have ever hated any one thing in my life\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as much as Wal-Mart, one employee told me shortly before those firings began, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be keeping his mouth shut because \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWal-Mart does not tolerate dissenters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWal-Mart denies that it retaliated for striking (but not that it punished some strikers for violating its attendance policy, a pretty specious distinction). The federal National Labor Relations Board announced this month that it was prepared to issue a complaint \\xe2\\x80\\x93 similar to an indictment \\xe2\\x80\\x93 against the company for illegally trying to restrain strikes; that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a symbolic victory for the campaign and one step in a potentially years-long legal process that could ultimately see fired employees returned to work.\\nBut what neither Wal-Mart nor OUR Walmart can come out and say is this: While core activists say they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re only emboldened by the fear campaign, by all appearances Wal-Mart threats and firings have so far succeeded in stemming the growth of Wal-Mart strikes. (Alternate explanation, per Wal-Mart: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe opportunity is incredible...We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never held a good person back.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) Organizers have declined to say whether today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s protests will see more employees out on strike than last year, but touted growth in total protests, civil disobedience actions, worker support and community backing. (Wal-Mart employee participation in a September 2013 day of civil disobedience and protests \\xe2\\x80\\x93 not strikes \\xe2\\x80\\x93 also numbered in the hundreds, according to the campaign.)\\nPlacerville Wal-Mart employee Dorothy Halvorson told me she was stirred to get more active with OUR Walmart when she saw the company crack down on her co-workers. But she said such retaliation \"has put fear back into some of the people that were thinking about joining us.\" When three activists were fired in her store, said Halvorson, others \"stepped back into like, \\'Oh no, we\\'ve got to be careful -- we might be fired too.\\'\" She said that because of the NLRB\\'s planned complaint against Wal-Mart, \"people are starting to feel more empowered again about doing it.\"\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy sense is that all the firings and stuff that took place last year; I mean I think that scared people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Kim Bobo, whose group Interfaith Worker Justice has adopted 150 stores for protests this year. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI mean, that was the intent, and I think it was effective.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But Bobo, who told me back in June that OUR Walmart would have to get \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfifty times bigger, probably\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in order to win, said she believed the NLRB\\xe2\\x80\\x99s move \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwill give the organizing a real lift,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think the only way workers organize and show solidarity and push the company is by striking.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d UFCW President Joe Hansen told me in September that it would be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunrealistic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to expect that \\xe2\\x80\\x9csomebody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to get 500,000 Wal-Mart workers to walk off their job, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c but that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat I think is happening, and I think Wal-Mart hates this as much as anything else, is it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s calling publicity to how they treat workers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Similarly, asked Wednesday whether victory would require thousands of Wal-Mart workers to join protests, the Rev. Jesse Jackson told me that \"the success may be in enough people saying, \\'I respect their mission\\' and shopping someplace else...The success of the Montgomery Bus Boycott was that people stopped trying to ride.\"\\nOUR Walmart and its allies can point to real victories from their already unprecedented activism, from a single store that paid workers for time they spent on strike, to a public commitment to improve scheduling nationwide. Last week\\xe2\\x80\\x99s media onslaught over one Wal-Mart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s employee-to-employee charity collection and last summer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s high-profile showdown over a passed-but-vetoed D.C. \\xe2\\x80\\x9clarge retailer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d living wage bill both show that comprehensive campaign tactics can pack some punch. But it was workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 strikes that laid groundwork and fueled momentum for both. As past failed union-backed efforts proved, Wal-Mart would sooner concede money than power, and public scrutiny and embarrassment alone stand little chance of dislodging real decency or democracy without a serious threat of escalating Wal-Mart worker uprisings.\\nSo the pressing question, for those concerned with the Wal-Mart-ization of U.S. work, is whether some combination of brave and savvy worker-to-worker organizing, bold minority activism and legal/political/media/consumer/community pressure can partially disarm or counteract the weapons Wal-Mart uses to inculcate a well-founded fear in its workforce. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll know more once we see what goes down today \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and how Wal-Mart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still-silent majority responds in the weeks and months to come.' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'In yet another bizarre turn of events at Brett Kavanaugh\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Supreme Court confirmation hearing, Republicans have revealed that documents Democratic Sen.

John Cornyn, R-Texas, told reporters after a chaotic start to the third day of Kavanaugh\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hearing.\\nEarlier Thursday, Booker dramatically said he would \\xe2\\x80\\x9cknowingly\\xe2\\x80\\x9d violate Senate rules to release emails marked \"committee confidential\" that showed Kavanaugh discussing racial profiling as a White House lawyer in 2002. Booker referred to his actions as an act of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccivil disobedience\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and said he was prepared to face punishment.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am going to release the e-mail about racial profiling and I understand that the penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Booker, a possible 2020 Democratic candidate for president.\\nAt another point, Booker said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is about the closest I&aposll probably ever have in my life to an, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I am Spartacus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 moment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut it turns out, Booker didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually break any rules with that release. The Republicans on the Judiciary Committee said they worked with the George W. Bush library and the Justice Department overnight to clear the emails. The restrictions were waived early Thursday morning.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe cleared the documents last night shortly after Senator Booker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s staff asked us to,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bill Burck, a lawyer for Bush involved in the release of documents. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe were surprised to learn about Senator Booker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly.\"\\n\"Apparently, some just wanted to break the rules and make a scene, but didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t check their email,\" a spokesman for committee Republicans said in a statement. The committee posted the same documents.\\n\"Clearly, he is running for president,\" GOP Sen. John Thune later told Fox News, speaking of Booker.\\nA spokeswoman for Booker said the lawmaker and Senate Democrats \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwere able to shame the committee into agreeing to make last night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s documents publicly available.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But she did not address when Booker first learned the materials had been cleared.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCory said this morning that he was releasing committee confidential documents, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exactly what he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s done,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Booker spokeswoman Kristin Lynch said.\\nLater Thursday, speaking to Fox News, Booker still insisted he violated the rules of the Senate.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI released the documents last night by reading from them in violation of the Senate rules,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nFurther, he posted even more emails via Twitter later Thursday afternoon which may have been designated \"confidential.\"\\nThe emails related to Kavanaugh&aposs comments on racial profiling appeared to be cleared in part because of the involvement of Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve said it before and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say it again: I will happily work with any of my colleagues from across the aisle to go through the necessary steps and processes to try and get specific classified documents released to the public,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lee tweeted.\\nBooker released 12 pages of emails \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which had been marked \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccommittee confidential\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 online for the public to read. The emails included internal post-9/11 discussions surrounding issues of racial profiling.\\nIn a 2002 email, Kavanaugh, who was working as a lawyer in the Bush White House, said he \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgenerally\\xe2\\x80\\x9d favored race-neutral security measures, but said they need to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgrapple\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinterim question of what to do before a truly effective and comprehensive race-neutral system is developed and implemented.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nKavanaugh wrote that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinterim question\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccritical importance to the security of the airlines and American people in the next 6 months or so, especially given Al Qaeda\\xe2\\x80\\x99s track record of timing between terrorist incidents.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe episode began a day earlier when Booker first implied Kavanaugh had been open to racial profiling tactics, citing the email exchange between Kavanaugh and a colleague.\\nHowever, Booker at the time did not provide Kavanaugh a copy of the emails to review while questioning him about it, prompting an objection from Lee, who charged that it was inappropriate to \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccross-examine\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Kavanaugh about documents that he \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe emails had been marked \"committee confidential.\" But Booker said Thursday he would release them anyway, saying the document is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreat illustration of the absurdity of the process\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing in it that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnational security-related.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nTop Republicans mocked and denounced Booker for the move.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRunning for president is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate or of confidentiality of the documents that we are privy to,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cornyn told Booker, before he was informed there was no violation.\\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, dinged Booker for repeating his point.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan I ask you how long you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to say the same thing three or four times?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Grassley asked.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m saying I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m knowingly violating the rules,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Booker replied. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSenator Cornyn has called me out for it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow many times are you going to tell us that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Grassley replied.\\nCornyn, at one point, read the Senate rule that said senators who disclose confidential business could suffer expulsion from the body.\\nBooker replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBring it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nA number of Democrats, including Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, threw their support behind Booker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s move.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI completely agree with you.

Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said. \"Unfortunately, it seems that some on the political left have decided to try to turn this hearing into a circus.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIt came as Kavanaugh entered the final stretch of questioning in his confirmation hearing Thursday with Democrats springing a series of cryptic questions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in an apparent attempt to box the nominee into an embarrassing admission or at least throw him off what has been a relatively steady performance.\\nUnder questioning, Kavanaugh denied that he once suggested the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling on abortion rights is not settled law. Kavanaugh has repeatedly described the abortion ruling as important Supreme Court precedent difficult to overturn.\\nKavanaugh was asked about a 2003 email which was disclosed Thursday, where he wrote: \"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so.\"\\nKavanaugh said he was not discussing his views, but rather \"what legal scholars might say.\"\\nOther lines of questioning from Democrats have been more mysterious, suggesting an effort to lay a trap.\\nIn an especially combative moment late Wednesday, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., asked Kavanaugh whether he ever had discussed Special Counsel Robert Mueller or his Russia probe with anyone at Kasowitz Benson Torres, the law firm founded by Marc Kasowitz, a former personal attorney to President Trump.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recall any conversations of that kind with anyone at that law firm\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t had any inappropriate conversations about that investigation with anyone,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Kavanaugh said Thursday, when given the chance to elaborate on Harris&apos question from a day earlier.\\nHe added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never given anyone any hints, forecasts, previews, winks, nothing about my view as a judge or how I would rule as a judge on that or anything related to that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nFor the most part, the hearings have focused on Kavanaugh\\xe2\\x80\\x99s writings and, in particular, key opinions he authored while serving on the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most prestigious appellate court.\\nThe confirmation hearing has been chaotic at times, with Democrats trying to delay the proceedings as they complain they haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t received enough records from Kavanaugh\\xe2\\x80\\x99s past work.\\nKavanaugh served for more than a decade on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and, before that, for five years as a lawyer in the White House Counsel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office in the George W. Bush administration. He also worked for independent counsel Ken Starr for three years during the probe that led to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton.\\nKavanaugh\\xe2\\x80\\x99s elevation from the D.C.

      "features:b'(CNN)The Trump administration\\'s reversal of Obama-era protections that allowed transgender students in public schools to use bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity has angered civil rights groups.\\nThe change in position Wednesday reignited the debate on whether guidance on transgender students\\' use of bathroom and locker room facilities is a state or federal rights issue.\\nHere are a few questions and answers to help explain how we got here:\\nWhat was the Obama administration\\'s position?\\nLast year, the Education and Justice departments issued joint guidance directing schools to let transgender students use facilities that correspond with their gender identity. The letter to school districts and colleges that receive federal funding was based on the Obama administration\\'s interpretation of Title IX, the federal law that bans sex discrimination in schools.\\nBut whether Title IX protections extend to a person\\'s gender identity depends on whom you ask. Though many states have laws consistent with the guidance, lawmakers and educators criticized the directive, saying it was federal overreach that threatened the safety and privacy of non-transgender students.\\nThe United States has 150,000 transgender youth between ages 13 and 17, according to UCLA\\'s Williams Institute.\\nWhy did the Trump administration revoke the directive?\\nIn a two-page letter to public schools, the Trump administration said the Obama-era directive did not provide \"extensive legal analysis\" of how its position was consistent with Title IX. The letter cited \"significant litigation\" caused by the guidance, showing the need for \"due regard\" of the role of states and local school districts in shaping education policy.\\n\"As President Trump has clearly stated, he believes policy regarding transgender bathrooms should be decided at the state level,\" the White House said in a statement. \"The joint decision made today by the Department of Justice and the Department of Education ... paves the way for an open and inclusive process to take place at the local level with input from parents, students, teachers and administrators.\"\\nWhat were the states\\' reactions to the guidelines?\\nOfficials in some states and cities, including Colorado, Iowa, Oregon, Washington state, San Francisco, New York City and the District of Columbia, consider denying transgender people the right to use a gender identity-appropriate restroom a violation of discrimination laws, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.\\nThe ACLU adds that in some cities, such as San Francisco, transgender people should not have to prove their gender to gain access to a public restroom unless others have to show an ID to use that restroom.\\nHow does the new guidance affect Gavin Grimm?\\nGavin Grimm, a 17-year-old transgender student from Virginia, was thrust into the national debate after he took his school district to court demanding it allow him to use the bathroom that corresponds to his gender identity.\\nIn ruling for Grimm and against the school district, a federal appeals court deferred to the Obama administration\\'s interpretation of Title IX. Last summer, the US Supreme Court dealt Grimm a setback, granting a request from the Gloucester County, Virginia, School Board to put a temporary hold on the appellate ruling while the justices consider an appeal. The Supreme Court is set to hear his case next month.\\nBut in a separate letter Wednesday, the Justice Department informed the high court that Obama\\'s guidance had been withdrawn. It\\'s unclear what will happen to Grimm\\'s case, but his argument was based on the Obama guidance and without it, his legal defense could suffer a major setback.\\nWhat has been the reaction to the new guidelines?\\nThe issue has sparked a fiery debate, with supporters of Obama\\'s guidelines applauding federal protections for transgender students while critics slammed them as overreach.\\nThe Family Research Council, a conservative Christian group, welcomed the new guidelines.\\n\"The Trump administration\\'s reversal of this mandate on schools is a victory for parents, children and privacy,\" council President Tony Perkins said in a statement.\\n\"The Obama administration resorted to this coercive policy because they knew parents and schools could never be persuaded to force boys and girls to shower together, stay together on school trips, and use the same locker rooms and bathrooms. As it turned out, the persistence of parents was far stronger than the government\\'s power of coercion.\"\\nCivil rights groups quickly pointed out that Wednesday\\'s announcement does not undo Title IX or state-level protections for transgender students.\\n\"While it\\'s disappointing to see the Trump administration revoke the guidance, the administration cannot change what Title IX means,\" said ACLU attorney Joshua Block, lead counsel for Grimm.\\nCNN\\'s Dani Stewart, Ariane de Vogue and Mary Kay Mallonee contributed this report.' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'PHOENIX \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Donald Trump, the real estate mogul and reality television star who has taken center stage in the race for the Republican presidential nomination this week, delivered a rambling monologue on Saturday, dismissing a long list of critics \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including Jeb Bush, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Macy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x94 while rallying what he termed a new silent majority of voters.\\nMr. Trump had less to say about immigration, the topic on which his comments have garnered so much attention, than about those who have criticized him. For more than an hour, he ticked through a list of businesses and candidates who have tried to censure him since his long-shot campaign began three weeks ago, and made light of their practices and intelligence.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow can I be tied with this guy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump said of Mr. Bush, whom many consider the Republican front-runner. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terrible. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s weak on immigration.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe speech had a distinctly celebratory air as Mr. Trump lauded the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmassive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d crowds he has drawn and the attention he has brought to immigration and other issues that he said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cweak\\xe2\\x80\\x9d politicians were afraid to address.\\nIt also demonstrated what his party fears most about him: that he is an orator without regard for decorum who is willing to mock other Republicans.\\nThe speech, hosted by the Republican Party of Maricopa County, drew several thousand people to the Phoenix Convention Center, making it one of the largest events for any candidate so far, though short of the crowd of 10,000 predicted by the Trump campaign. Outside, in the 100-degree desert heat, supporters who could not make it into the room waved American flags and sparred with a smaller but vocal group of protesters.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe silent majority is back, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take our country back,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump declared as he left the stage.\\nSheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, whose tactics in tracking down illegal immigrants drew national attention and a federal ruling against him for racial profiling in 2013, preceded Mr. Trump on stage at the businessman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s invitation.\\nAs he had earlier in the day in Las Vegas, Mr. Trump also brought to the stage Jamiel Shaw Sr., the father of a teenager killed in 2008 by an undocumented immigrant in Los Angeles, to share the story of his son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death and to endorse Mr. Trump.\\nMr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trip to the immigrant-heavy border region was the first since he asserted in his campaign announcement on June 16 that those crossing the United States-Mexico border illegally included rapists and criminals. Those remarks have earned Mr. Trump sharp criticism from business and political leaders across the country, including companies such as Macy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, Univision and NBC that have cut ties with him in recent weeks.\\nHe came to Phoenix after addressing a series of private and public audiences Friday and Saturday in Los Angeles and Las Vegas.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis has become a movement because people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be great if we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a border.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nHis welcome here was not entirely warm. Phoenix\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vice mayor and several pro-immigrant groups had called for the city to bar him from speaking at the convention center, which it owns. Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, rejected those calls, saying he would respect Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right to free speech.\\nBut just as Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presence in the nominating race has confounded national Republican leaders trying to expand the party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appeal to minority groups, his visit here posed a dilemma for state officials trying to distance themselves from the anti-immigrant policies of the recent past.\\nArizona\\xe2\\x80\\x99s senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, both Republicans, decided not to attend the event, as did the Republican governor, Doug Ducey. Mr. Flake also called on the Maricopa County Republican Party to rescind its invitation to Mr. Trump, a request that was ignored.\\nOn Saturday, Mr. Flake said Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remarks, which he called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cintolerant\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinaccurate,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d would hurt Republicans here and around the country as they attempt to appeal to a broader demographic of voters.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cParticularly in Arizona, we have had such a long stretch of this kind of rhetoric and this kind of talk,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Flake said in a telephone interview before Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe seem to be moving beyond that here, and this kind of rhetoric just pulls us back.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nFor many here, the event revived an image of the state, embodied by Sheriff Arpaio, as unwelcoming and harsh in its enforcement of illegal immigration laws \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a perception that Mr. Ducey has worked hard to dispel.

Mr. Donaldson said Mr. Trump could have been more artful in crafting his points about illegal immigration, in particular, but thought that the abrasive approach was actually helping him in the polls.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think his delivery on some of his points could use a little finesse,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also what I like most about him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d' target:-1\n",

Though quixotic secession efforts are as regular as drought around here, New California got a surprising flurry of mainstream attention last week after the group released its official \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDeclaration of Independence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But what he called the \\xe2\\x80\\x9coverwhelming worldwide response\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of website hits, emails, phone calls, and retweets didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t translate to interest in this announcement\\xe2\\x80\\x94my photographer and I were the only media members in attendance.\\nLuckily or unluckily, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have more chances to hear the announcement\\xe2\\x80\\x9439 more grievances will be aired, every Tuesday at 11 AM, at various county buildings throughout the state.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt sounds kind of strange, but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way they used to do it in the old days,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Paul Preston, the founder of the movement, who told me they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll keep the specific locations of future airings secret until the day before. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s controversial, and I well imagine that people will be trying to shut us down.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nPreston says he began thinking about a secessionist movement five years ago, when he linked up with the folks behind the proposed 51st State of Jefferson, an organization trying to break California into two states, the northern one encompassing the far more conservative chunk of the state. But when Jefferson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leadership decided on a strategy of using \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe lawsuit option,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Preston became disenchanted and decided to start his own secessionist movement. (Neither of these efforts are to be confused with venture capitalist Tim Draper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan of splitting California into six different states, which, according to Preston, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cisn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to succeed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)\\nIn May of last year, Preston, a resident of Yuba City\\xe2\\x80\\x9440 miles due north of Sacramento and a short drive from Rough and Ready, a town that seceded from America for a few months in 1849 until it ran out of booze\\xe2\\x80\\x94began reaching out to like-minded individuals throughout the state. He says he vetted them to make sure \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re competent and capable, and in a position where they can understand the process and move forward.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The plan is for each to start their own county committee, a process that he hopes will galvanize groundswell support enough to bypass the state government in Sacramento and bring their case to the federal level.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are a neutral body moving forward to persuade, ultimately, the Legislature and Senate to approve our state split,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Preston, who stakes his movement\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim to legitimacy on Article 4, Section 3 of the US Constitution, which says that new states can be formed out of existing states as long as the US Congress and the relevant state legislature give their approval. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou know those crazy guys with those pocket Constitutions? There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a reason for it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Preston.\\nTo become involved in these committees, one must either be a resident of the county it is representing, or a resident of the state and a landowner of the county. This distinction is important, as it highlights the ideological split between \\xe2\\x80\\x9cone person, one vote\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cone acre, one vote\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that seems to be at the core of this effort. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat we have is a lack of representation in New California,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Preston. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn rural communities, we are not represented properly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nTo Preston, this is due to the 1964 Supreme Court case  Reynolds v. Sims, which dictated that state legislative districts must be drawn with roughly equal population numbers in mind. This ruling has predictably led a state district map that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s composed of huge chunks in the rural areas, and microscopic puzzle pieces in the urban ones. If one believes that land ownership should dictate the power of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vote, this is infuriating; if one leans to the right, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doubtless frustrating that the population-based rule has given Democrats a near-supermajority in both chambers of the California Legislature.\\nDespite Preston\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim that his movement isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t intended to divide the state along \\xe2\\x80\\x9cliberal versus Republican\\xe2\\x80\\x9d lines, the group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reliance on preexisting county borderlines has resulted in extremely pliable definitions of \\xe2\\x80\\x9crural\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9curban.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d According to the proposed map, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOld\\xe2\\x80\\x9d California will consist of the greater Bay Area and parts of the delta watershed into Sacramento, but not Contra Costa County, the most conservative part of the Bay. It will also include most of the coastline down into Los Angeles, but not the heavily populated counties of San Diego, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, or Fresno, which are also relatively conservative. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt some point we have to have some population,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Preston of those lines.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also hard not to see that this secessionist effort is tinged with a heavy coat of the same right-wing reactionary outrage that simmers in the rural areas. Preston is the founder of the conservative streaming station Agenda 21 Radio, a member of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAmerican Exceptionalism News Network,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which seems like a network of exactly one program.

      "features:b'Beginning on June 6, 1944, more than 150,000 Allied troops landed on a broad stretch of beaches on the coast of Normandy, in German-held France. Entrenched behind concrete walls and bunkers were more than 50,000 German soldiers. Seventy years later, four veterans of the largest amphibious invasion in history recall their experiences.\\nSWEETWATER, Tenn. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 We awoke at 2 a.m. on June 7, 1944, the day after D-Day. After a hearty breakfast at our base in Britain, we secured our equipment and walked a mile to our British Horsa gliders. The first glider, towed by a cargo plane, took off at 4:35 a.m. for Normandy, a little over two hours away. It was still dark.\\nThe gliders, which carried up to 25 men, were a critical part of the invasion: Silent and fast, they were used to insert advance troops behind enemy lines. Hundreds of them flew into France during those first few days.\\nI remember looking out the canopy and seeing the moon break through the clouds. I was sitting next to the pilot, and I could see thousands of invasion ships in the English Channel.\\nAbout halfway over the channel, the tow plane lost power, and we were going down. When the tow plane pilot regained power, we realized the tow rope had become wrapped around our landing gear, and when the rope stretched out it flipped the glider and we almost went into the channel \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but then the glider pilot was able to wiggle the controls and shake the rope into place.\\nEverything went well after we got through the antiaircraft fire along the coast, except that we were unable to land in our designated zone. We could see that the Germans, suspecting a glider-borne attack, had set up explosives-tipped posts in the landing field.\\nBy now the tow plane had disengaged, so we had to act fast. The pilot saw a small plot nearby, surrounded by hedges and trees. As we landed our wing cut the top out of a big tree. The glider hit the ground so hard it broke the antenna off my field radio. We bounced two or three times before rolling to a stop.\\nWhile I was replacing the antenna, two German Me-109 fighter planes flew over and strafed us good. We had landed near the town of Sainte-Marie-du-Mont, next to an apple orchard, and I remember seeing an old Frenchman milking a cow nearby, with the shells bursting all around him.\\nThat day we pushed through to the strategically important village of Sainte-M\\xc3\\xa8re-\\xc3\\x89glise. Our mission was to keep the roads and bridges to the beaches open for the troops coming in by landing craft.\\nOur first real engagement came on June 9, when we attacked a German unit a little after midnight. We soon found ourselves in a trap. Out of the little more than 100 men in my unit, Company B, we lost 19 that day.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Clinton Riddle served in the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division.\\nKENT, England \\xe2\\x80\\x94I have no idea what time it was on June 6, 1944, when we boarded an enormous troop ship in Newhaven, England, but it was dark.\\nSome hours later the order was given to line up to board the assault craft \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the small boats tied up alongside the ship that would take us to the beach. So there we were, in a line across the deck, with a small pack containing explosives, tin hat, loaded rifle, full ammunition packs and a bandoleer with even more ammunition.\\nWe were all nervous, but one of my abiding memories is standing with a whole tin of corned beef in one hand and a hunk of bread covered with thick butter in the other and thinking, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I am killed and this is the condemned man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s last meal, I wish it was some of my mum\\xe2\\x80\\x99s home cooking.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (As it turned out, that was the last piece of bread I ate for about four months \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it was hardtack biscuits from then on.)\\nWhen we were about four miles from the shore we were ordered to get into the craft, which bobbed several feet below the deck. We lined up to make the jump one by one, from one moving deck to another.\\nThe sea was choppy, rising up and down by about 16 feet, bringing the smaller craft up next to the ship and then moving them out of reach, so we had to judge the right time to jump and hope for the best. A few of our blokes misjudged it and were crushed between the hulls.\\nOnce we were in the craft we took off for shore. Everyone knew that they might be dead within minutes. I feel sure we all prayed; I certainly did. And I remember thinking of home: my mum and dad and my sister, Marian, and my girlfriend, Eileen, and that we might never see each other again.\\nThe ramp went down at Gold Beach and our training took over. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think about the other men. There was no time; it was all about keeping yourself alive. We jumped into water that came up to our chests and waded to shore, loaded with equipment that was only getting heavier as it got wetter.\\nWe ran up the beach, looking for cover. The Germans were firing along the beach from houses at Le Hamel; casualties were mounting. When I got up against the sea wall, I looked back and saw dead and mutilated bodies everywhere, in the sea and on the beach. I had arrived in France.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 George Batts served with the Royal Engineers.\\nBERLIN \\xe2\\x80\\x94 It was a few days after the invasion at Normandy had begun, and we had been under intense fire from American naval artillery since daybreak. Mercilessly and without pause, shells of every caliber plowed toward us, shredding everything that stood in their way.\\nI could feel my breath getting heavy as the pressure from the explosions sucked the air out of my lungs. When the ground shook under the force of the impacts, there was no one in our unit, not even the most hard-boiled, who was not brought low by fear and a sense of total powerlessness in his foxhole.\\nWhen, after five hours, the barrage finally ended, I regained my senses and looked around. I saw nothing but a destroyed landscape, bare trees and leafless branches that stretched up their stumps as a reminder of peace in the overcast sky. I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t count all the craters made by artillery shells, which had turned Normandy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s green fields and meadows into a moonscape.\\nThere in the village of Carentan, inland from the landing zone at Utah Beach, a dogged battle unfolded between my unit, the Sixth Paratrooper Regiment, and the American 101st Airborne Division. I was just 21 years old. There was no place for pity or compassion, and I had no idea that the enemy I was ordered to shoot at would be, decades later, the same people I would greet as friends every year at the anniversary of the invasion.\\nIt was there, at Carentan, that I decided I had had enough of the war. I took cover behind the cadavers of some cows and calves that had been hit by artillery shells, their massive bodies riddled with holes. The smell of rot and excrement was everywhere. One of the animals was still alive, and I used her bloated body as protection.\\nWas this the first sign of a nascent brutalization within me? What else was I capable of? Had my parents raised me to die here, in a senseless death-struggle for the fatherland?\\nMy regiment paid a disproportionately high price for the fighting spirit it displayed at the Battle of Carentan in June 1944. Out of somewhat less than 1,000 men, 43 died and 89 were wounded. They bled as much from the incompetence of German generals as the material superiority of the enemy.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Joachim Dahms served in the Sixth Paratrooper Regiment of the German Army.\\nOTTAWA \\xe2\\x80\\x94 In early 1943 my division, the Third Canadian Infantry, was selected to be part of an Allied invasion armada, then still in the early planning stages. That October we participated in landing exercises on Bournemouth Bay, on England\\xe2\\x80\\x99s south coast.\\nLive ammunition whistled overhead as we practiced under the watchful eye of Bernard Montgomery, the commander in chief of the British and Canadian forces. Our training continued through that winter, in England and Scotland.\\nOn Jan. 6, General Montgomery told a few of us at headquarters exactly where our division would land in Normandy: on Juno Beach, the second most eastern of the landing zones. This was a closely guarded secret, because most Germans believed that the Pas de Calais, to the north, would be the main landing area.\\nEven though the Germans had concentrated their troops at Calais, we would still have to get past the fortifications of the Atlantic Wall, which the Germans had been building for years. Juno was particularly well defended.\\nWe knew we would not be able to destroy the beach\\xe2\\x80\\x99s huge bunkers with shells, so that spring we asked the British to send frogmen, on a moonless night, to measure them. We used those measurements to build replicas on Bournemouth Bay, and our chief engineer devised an ingenious way for the first wave of troops to remove them: soldiers crawled up to them and hooked ropes to the wall; armored tractors then pulled at the other end of the rope until the wall gave way.\\nOn D-Day our division was reinforced with a brigade of tanks and a detachment of British troops. The latter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s task was to help guide incoming troops and clear the beaches of debris and explosives. As more troops arrived, we gave them folding bicycles to speed up their push inland.\\nI landed about 11 a.m. Though there was much damage and many civilians wounded or killed, the French were overjoyed to see the Germans routed by the Canadians and other allies. But seeing so many of my comrades who gave up their lives or were wounded left me with a feeling of how costly liberty is.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Ernest C\\xc3\\xb4t\\xc3\\xa9 served in the Third Canadian Infantry Division.' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'Progress.\\nIt\\'s been seemingly nonexistent in Washington for weeks, as Republicans and Democrats squabbled about funding the government and whether to raise its borrowing limit. Both sides drew their lines in the sand and talked vociferously at each other, but not to each other.\\nOn Thursday, 10 days into the government\\'s partial shutdown, the tide appeared to turn. House Republicans offered a plan to temporarily stave off the threat of a first-ever U.S. debt default. President Barack Obama listened to them. Both sides agreed to keep on talking.\\nSaid Rep. Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican: \"We\\'re all working together now.\"\\nSessions spoke early Thursday evening after he and fellow House Republicans talked with Obama at the White House.\\nAfterward, the Obama administration described the session as \"good\" -- saying the President listened to Republican proposals and the two sides discussed \"potential paths forward.\"\\nAnd House Majority Leader Eric Cantor called it \"very useful.\"\\n\"We\\'re going to have more discussions on both sides tonight,\" the Virginia Republican said.\\nThe fact the two sides are talking, though, doesn\\'t mean they have agreed to anything yet.\\nAfter all, they have been bitterly divided on party lines for weeks, routinely throwing barbs but rarely trading proposals.\\nHouse Republicans initially passed a series of measures tying government funding to defunding or dismantling Obamacare, the president\\'s signature health care reform. And they\\'ve insisted that they won\\'t increase the nation\\'s borrowing limit without cuts first.\\nObama, meanwhile, has been just as firm in his position: Pass \"clean\" -- meaning no add-ons or qualifications -- bills to fund the government and raise the debt limit, and only then will we talk.\\nOne big deadline passed without an agreement -- October 1, when the partial shutdown began no funding had been authorized to keep the government running.\\nAnd there seemed little movement toward addressing the next one -- October 17, when the Treasury Department has said the government will run out of money to pay its bills unless something is done.\\nNow a plan from House Republicans to temporarily boost the nation\\'s borrowing limit and start talks about reopening the government shifted the dynamic.\\nWhat it didn\\'t do was meet Democrats\\' demand to fund the government right away. Asked after attending a White House meeting of his own Thursday with the President about the prospect of the debt limit lifting while the government stays partially closed, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid didn\\'t mince words: \"It\\'s not going to happen.\"\\nObama made clear, during his session with House Republicans, that he won\\'t give concessions to reopen the government, according to a Democratic source familiar with the meeting.\\nYet no less than White House spokesman Jay Carney cheered the movement, saying Obama was \"happy that cooler heads at least seem to be prevailing in the House\" over the need to avoid a possible default.\\nWill 2014 election solve anything?\\nDeep into Thursday night, these heads were getting together to try to find a resolution. The White House hopes these initial staff-level discussions will let it know exactly what Republicans want, the Democratic source said.\\nRep. Hal Rogers, a Kentucky Republican, said both sides are talking \"in good faith\" about not just the debt ceiling, but what it will take to restart the government.\\n\"There was not a timeline set,\" said Rogers. \"But we want to move quickly.\"\\nAnti-Obamacare provisions no longer in GOP plans\\nOptimism in Washington triggered relief on Wall Street as the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its biggest one-day gain of the year at 323 points. Investors have been nervous over the political stalemate and the possibility of a debt default and its potential economic consequences.\\nThis came a day after Obama said in a separate meeting with House Democrats that he would consider a short-term deal to raise the federal borrowing limit, a Democratic lawmaker told CNN.\\n\"If that\\'s what (House Speaker John) Boehner needs to climb out of the tree that he\\'s stuck in, then that\\'s something we should look at,\" according to the lawmaker, who attended the meeting and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\\nSome congressional Democrats have balked at the outline of the GOP offer, saying the government must reopen and the debt ceiling must be increased to get broader talks going.\\n\"One way or another both of those have to happen,\" said veteran Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan.\\nAnother Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, said Obama \"needs to press for the opening of the government.\"\\n\"Without a doubt the default would be much more catastrophic, but I\\'ve got constituents, a lot of whom work for the federal government who are going through catastrophes every hour,\" Cummings said.\\nPaul Ryan steps into budget fight\\nOne thing any budget resolution won\\'t include, it appears, is provisions targeting the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\\nRyan, who was the Republican party\\'s vice presidential nominee last year, didn\\'t mention Obamacare in a Wall Street Journal op-ed -- saying instead that politicians from both parties should focus on \"modest reforms to entitlement programs and the tax code.\"\\nAs others have done in recent days, GOP Rep. James Lankford of Oklahoma told CNN on Thursday that going after the President\\'s signature health reform is \"currently off the table.\"\\nYet Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas -- one of the most vocal Republicans in the debate -- wasn\\'t so ready to let the health care issue go. Speaking Thursday on CNN\\'s \"Crossfire,\" he said \"Democrats in this town do not want to discuss Obamacare.\"\\nOn Obama\\'s signature health care reform and what\\'s happening in Washington generally, Cruz said that it\\'s House Republicans who \"are listening to the millions of Americans\" to do what\\'s best for them.\\nAccording to a GOP source, it\\'s not certain whether Boehner can gain support from some or most of his GOP caucus to support a plan without anything to do with Obamacare or other concessions.

      "features:b'Washington (CNN) - President Barack Obama comes out of what was arguably the worst week of his presidency with his approval rating holding steady, according to a new national poll.\\nBut a CNN/ORC International survey released Sunday morning also indicates that congressional Republicans are not overplaying their hand when it comes to their reaction to the three controversies that have consumed the nation\\'s capital over the past week and a half. And the poll finds that a majority of Americans take all three issues seriously.\\nFollow @politicalticker\\nAccording to the survey, which was conducted Friday and Saturday, 53% of Americans say they approve of the job the president is doing, with 45% saying they disapprove. The president\\'s approval rating was at 51% in CNN\\'s last poll, which was conducted in early April.\\n\"That two-point difference is well within the poll\\'s sampling error, so it is a mistake to characterize it as a gain for the president,\" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. \"Nonetheless, an approval rating that has not dropped and remains over 50% will probably be taken as good news by Democrats after the events of the last week.\"\\nThe CNN poll is in-line with Gallup, which also indicated a very slight rise in Obama\\'s approval rating over the same time period. And Gallup\\'s daily tracking poll also indicated a slight upward movement of Obama\\'s approval rating over the past week. But as with the CNN poll, it was within that survey\\'s sampling error.\\nMore than seven in 10 in the CNN poll say that the targeting by the Internal Revenue Service of tea party and other conservative groups that were applying for tax exempt status was unacceptable. While the White House and both parties in Congress are criticizing the IRS actions, congressional Republicans are depicting the controversy as a case of the federal government gone wild.\\nBut more than six in 10 say that the president\\'s statements about the IRS scandal are completely or mostly true, with 35% not agreeing with Obama\\'s characterizations. And 55% say that IRS acted on its own, with 37% saying that White House ordered the IRS to target tea party and other conservative groups.\\nOnly 42% of the public is satisfied with how the Obama administration has handled the September attack in Benghazi, Libya, which left the U.S ambassador to that country and three other Americans dead. Fifty-three percent say they are dissatisfied. But those numbers are virtually unchanged from November.\\nRepublicans have ripped the administration for not providing adequate security for the Benghazi mission, botching the response to it, and misleading the public for political gain with the attack coming less than two months before last November\\'s presidential election.\\nAccording to the poll, 44% say statements made by the Obama administration soon after the attack were an attempt to intentionally mislead the public. Half of those questioned say those statements reflected what the Obama administration believed, at the time, had occurred.\\nBut 59% now say that the U.S government could have prevented the attack in Benghazi, up 11 points from last November. And only 37% say that congressional Republicans are overreacting in their handling of the matter, with 59% saying they\\'ve reacted appropriately.\\nIt\\'s the same story on the IRS controversy, with 54% saying the GOP in Congress has not overplayed its hand.\\nThe White House has also been criticized by Congress for the Justice Department\\'s secret collection of phone records from the Associated Press as part of a government investigation into classified leaks. According to the poll, 52% say the Justice Department\\'s actions were unacceptable, with 43% saying they disagree.\\nAmericans appear to be taking all three controversies very seriously, with 55% saying the IRS and Benghazi matters are very important to the nation and 53% saying the same thing about the AP case.\\n\"More Republicans than Democrats or Independents say these three issues are very important to the nation, but even among Democrats, nearly half say the matters are very serious,\" Holland adds.\\nAre Americans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 trust in the government shaken?\\nOnly 43% say they have a great deal or some confidence in the people who run the federal government. But 56% say they have a great deal or some confidence in the system of government.\\nThe CNN poll was conducted by ORC International between May 17-18, with 923 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey\\'s sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.\\n\\\\- CNN Political Editor Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.' target:-1\n",

Despite a flurry of negotiations over the past week, and some movement among centrist Republicans toward a compromise that continued over the weekend, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s little indication the outcome will be any different this time.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Republicans have to look at themselves in the mirror and they have to look at their constituents in the eye this November,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sen.

The National Rifle Association backed a bill from GOP leaders that Democrats won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t accept. Democrats mounted a high-profile filibuster to press for more gun regulations \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a deeply politicized response, in Republicans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 view.\\nThe uncertainty that remains is whether centrists in either party can craft a deal and sell it to their leaders \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which aides on both sides of the aisle say is a long shot.\\nInstead, Monday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s votes will be all about gaining political advantage in the November election and positioning each party for any effort to take up gun restrictions in 2017, when a group of red-state Democrats will be facing reelection the following year.\\nBut this fall, Democrats plan to accuse vulnerable Republicans of being more interested in doing the NRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bidding than making the country safe. Republicans counter that Democrats are the ones exploiting a tragedy, the killing of 49 people at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida.\\nThe leader of the filibuster, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), said the effort led by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) to draft a compromise bill on preventing potential terrorists from buying guns would not have happened without his nearly 15-hour speech.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is consensus here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Murphy said Sunday on ABC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis Week.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNone of that would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been happening if we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stand up and conduct that filibuster. We were just going to go on, like business as usual.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut Republicans say Democrats have already gone too far by forcing GOP senators to vote against Democratic measures \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and then, in all likelihood, turn the votes into fodder for ads against Republicans.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI understand what Chuck Schumer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motivation is,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), whose efforts to find a middle ground were brusquely shrugged off by the same Democratic senators working to oust him from his Senate seat this fall.\\nBehind the scenes, several Republicans are working with centrist Democrats on a compromise that could pass the Senate. Collins backs a bill that would create a narrow list of suspected terrorists who would be barred outright from buying firearms. Her measure would also set up a broader list of suspected terrorists that would be used to notify federal authorities if someone on the bigger list tried to purchase a gun.\\nThose negotiations continued over the weekend, and even some conservatives seemed hopeful.\\n\"Susan is so careful about those things and she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worked really hard to figure out the differences in various lists and what kind of proof it takes to get on that list,\" Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) said on CNN\\'s \"State of the Union\" on Sunday. \"Some way we should be able to make this work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut Republican leaders have already allowed four votes on gun measures for Monday \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that alone was a win for Democrats given the limited calendar time and proximity to the election. Republicans are growing tired of responding to the Democratic minority on an issue that could be troublesome for them in blue and purple states.\\nRepublicans would rather turn the scrutiny away from themselves and on to President Barack Obama, who they argue has failed to effectively respond to the Islamic State, the genesis of the terrorism threat against the United States.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to actually talk about the real cause of that attack, and that is a terrorist attack on our own soil, and why the policies both in the Middle East and here at home are inadequate to deal with the threat of homegrown radicalization,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas).\\nThe votes on Monday evening are likely to break on familiar partisan lines.\\nThe first two will focus broadly on background checks for gun sales. That issue stymied the Democratic-led Senate in 2013, which could not advance legislation just months after 20 children and six adults were killed at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.\\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) has a proposal meant to improve the National Instant Criminal Background Checks System by boosting its funding and trying to make it easier for the system to gain records it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t already have. The measure would also revise legal definitions on who is barred from owning a gun due to mental-health considerations.\\nAs a counter, Senate Democrats, led by Murphy, are pushing a bill that would require background checks for all firearms sales by private sellers, including at gun shows and over the Internet. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s similar to legislation written by Toomey with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) that did not pass in 2013. The Democratic plan also has provisions to bolster the records kept by the background checks system.\\nBy making the bill different than the one supported by Toomey, a senior GOP aide argued the proposal is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cintentionally partisan.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Toomey is likely to oppose Murphy\\'s background checks because it is more restrictive than the 2013 universal background checks bill.\\nThe final pair of votes is likely to get more attention in light of the Orlando shootings and the massacre in San Bernardino, California, which were both primarily carried out by U.S. citizens who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State.\\nThe Democratic plan, written by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), would allow the Justice Department to block sales of guns to people who are suspected of having terrorist ties. Republicans have said Feinstein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proposal would intrude on the Second Amendment rights of those who are wrongly included on federal terror watch lists. Meanwhile, the GOP plan drafted by Cornyn would halt a sale only if a judge found probable cause that the person trying to buy the gun is involved in terrorist activities. Democrats say that burden of proof is too high.\\nAll of the proposals need 60 votes in the GOP-controlled Senate to advance. In December, just one Senate Democrat voted against Feinstein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. The moderate senator, who is up for reelection in 2018 and has been a source of deep frustration for gun-control advocates, has not signaled she will change her mind.\\nJust one Republican voted with the rest of the Democrats in December: Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, who has perhaps the toughest reelection race among incumbent GOP senators this fall. He issued a news release Friday touting himself as a co-author of the Feinstein plan.\\nThe NRA is keeping the pressure on Republicans to hold the line. In an interview on CBS\\' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, the group\\'s vice president and chief executive, Wayne LaPierre, called the Democratic push for new gun restrictions an intentional distraction.\\nTrying to fight terrorism with gun control legislation is like \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctrying to stop a freight train with a piece of Kleenex,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d LaPierre said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd this president, by diverting the attention to the gun control movement, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to solve the problem.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d' target:-1\n",

They broke down filing deadlines in certain states, projected how much money Clinton would need to raise and described how field operations have become more sophisticated in the era of Barack Obama.\\nStory Continued Below\\nThe meeting was organized by Minyon Moore, a longtime Clinton intimate also at Dewey Square who has informally become the potential candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s political eyes and ears of late.

It appears to have been the only formal 2016-related presentation Clinton has been given from anyone outside her immediate circle.\\nPublicly, Clinton insists she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s many months away from a decision about her political future. But a shadow campaign on her behalf has nevertheless been steadily building for the better part of a year \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a quiet, intensifying, improvisational effort to lay the groundwork for another White House bid.\\n( PHOTOS: Hillary Clinton's 50 influentials)\\nSome of the activity has the former first lady\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tacit approval. Some involves outside groups that are operating independently, and at times in competition with one another, to prepare a final career act for the former senator and secretary of state, whose legacy as the most powerful woman in the history of American politics is already secure.\\nMore than two dozen people in her orbit interviewed for this article described a virtual campaign in waiting \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a term that itself makes some of Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supporters bristle \\xe2\\x80\\x94 consisting of longtime Clinton loyalists as well as people who worked doggedly to elect her onetime rival Obama.\\nThere are two spheres of influence. One is made up of more than a dozen Clinton staffers, loyalists and longtime friends whose advice she values the most.\\nThe other sphere is more complex. It includes an assortment of super PACs and outside groups, all jockeying to be part of the Clinton movement but operating beyond her immediate direction and control. Still, some of these efforts could become the foundation of an eventual campaign.\\n( Also on POLITICO: How Clinton's fared in the polls)\\nFor all the genuine excitement about the prospect that Clinton, 66, could shatter the glass ceiling she famously invoked in 2008, the potential for rancor among these groups is real.\\nIn at least one instance last year, two super PACs collided over efforts to get behind a Clinton candidacy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 forcing her allies to intervene.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s upside and there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s risk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to this patchwork of outside forces, said Tad Devine, an unaffiliated strategist who worked on John Kerry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2004 presidential campaign, when Democratic-leaning outside groups often acted at odds with the candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s message.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe upside is that people are out there doing valuable and important work for you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.

In addition to a moniker that irked some Clinton allies \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they thought it had an air of inevitability that plagued her in the past \\xc2\\xad \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the group was making an aggressive play for activists and donors to back their effort.\\n( PHOTOS: Who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talking about Hillary Clinton 2016?)\\nAt the same time, Priorities USA, the main super PAC behind Obama in 2012, was in discussions to reinvent itself as a pro-Hillary Clinton endeavor. That would mean appealing to some of those same supporters. The two groups also had wildly different views of how active to be while Clinton was assessing whether to run.\\nThe Priorities official warned Abedin that the situation could become problematic for Clinton if it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t resolved. The official sought guidance from someone who had the would-be candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ear.\\nThe efforts of pro-Clinton outside groups over the past half-year, and the Clinton allies trying to corral them, reflect a much-changed political landscape since Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s last run. Back then, super PACs didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exist. Potential candidates who needed campaign prep work done had to set up an exploratory committee or PAC under their own direct control.\\nNow super PACs are a must-have political accessory for candidates of all stripes.\\nThe groups can raise and spend unlimited sums in support of a candidate and perform key tasks the person isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ready to do. In Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case, Priorities will probably line up pledges from big donors. Ready for Hillary is building email lists.

Clinton herself was forced to grapple with the run-in between the two groups; several sources familiar with the discussions said she wanted to keep her team distant from the work of the super PACs to avoid brushing up against rules forbidding coordination. But Clinton made clear to aides that the mess, which in many ways echoed the factionalism of her past, needed to be sorted out.\\nIn a series of meetings in Washington and New York, advisers to both groups huddled to address the problem. John Podesta, the former chief of staff to Bill Clinton who recently joined the Obama White House, was among the participants brought in on the Priorities side to help.\\nSome suggested trying to force Ready for Hillary to shut down. That idea was rejected out of concern it would prompt negative stories about Clinton forces stomping on the grass roots.\\nAnother adviser proposed merging the two super PACs, but that also went nowhere.\\n( PHOTOS: Hillary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s world tour, 2009-2012)\\nEventually they settled on a solution: Ready for Hillary would focus on collecting and analyzing voter data, accepting donations up to $25,000. Priorities would be the super PAC for mega-donors, working solely on paid advertising.\\nReady for Hillary has since won over key people close to Clinton impressed by its efforts like cultivating detailed lists of supporters through social media, which Clinton didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do in 2008. Among other moves, it brought on Craig Smith, a White House political director for Bill Clinton and friend from his Arkansas days. He gave the aura of an adult in the room to a group created by younger former Clinton staffers.\\nMost important is that Moore, whose background is in field organizing, is said to believe in the work the group is doing, as does Baker of Dewey Square, according to several sources. Besides the email list, Ready for Hillary is building a massive, 50-state direct-mail and voter targeting program. In a sign of cooperation, the group rented Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supporter list from her old PAC. It also brought on Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s field gurus, Mitch Stewart and Jeremy Bird, to help build up its efforts, including by supporting local candidates who Clinton backs in this year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s midterm elections.\\nReady for Hillary hopes to make its data available to a 2016 Clinton campaign, and some Clinton allies believe there are a number of young aides and operatives working for the super PAC who could become part of her campaign. The 2008 campaign had many well-documented flaws, but one was the failure to prominently deploy young campaign talent, which flocked to Obama.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you wonder whether Clintonworld has learned our lessons from 2008, look no further than the work of Ready for Hillary,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one source supportive of its work.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s far from certain the outside group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voter data would be welcomed by a Clinton campaign; it will likely prefer to compile its own. Or, some Clinton associates say, it could choose from any number of outside campaign data firms, including two launched by Obama 2012 veterans after his reelection.\\nElsewhere in the constellation of outside groups doing work related to Clinton is EMILY\\xe2\\x80\\x99s List, led by operative Stephanie Schriock, who is frequently mentioned as a possible Clinton campaign manager. The group, which focuses on electing women and isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a super PAC, is conducting an expansive polling project about attitudes toward female candidates. Correct the Record, the Brock-sponsored rapid response project, is being managed by a Hillary Clinton favorite, Burns Strider, and has her allies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 nod of approval.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis effort for Hillary, unprecedented in both its early timing and scope, is a demonstration of the extent to which the Democratic Party is unified behind this potential candidacy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one of the organizers.\\nFrom Obama \\xe2\\x80\\x9808 to Clinton \\xe2\\x80\\x9816\\nTwo of the boldest-faced names to enter the Clinton constellation in 2013 tied their political fortunes to electing Obama in 2008: Jim Messina, who went on to become a top political hand in the White House and then run Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reelection, and Hollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg.\\n( PHOTOS: Stars line up for Hillary Clinton 2016)\\nDespite his late arrival to Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign in 2008 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come on board until after the bloody primary \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Messina was seen by Clinton aides as carrying a deep grudge from the campaign to the White House. Some Clinton associates suspected he was behind a failed attempt to scuttle two of her top staff picks at State: Capricia Marshall and Philippe Reines.\\nBut what Messina lacks in longtime loyalty to Clinton, he makes up for in connections to Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vast network of donors and activists. That had obvious value to a group like Priorities USA, which early last year was looking to morph from its 2012 version that decimated Mitt Romney with a series of attack ads into a pro-Clinton endeavor for 2016.\\nEarly last year, Messina, who quietly admired Priorities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 work in 2012, started talking informally to the super PAC about a role. One draw is that working on a super PAC is less of a grind, and certainly more lucrative, than an actual campaign.\\nThe discussions went on for months last year, long before news reports in November that he was in serious talks to become a co-chairman of the group. But some Clinton allies have grumbled that Messina\\xe2\\x80\\x99s swelling list of business clients could potentially embarrass Clinton; his backers dismiss the complaints as professional jealousy, saying plenty of Clinton advisers have their own potential business conflicts.\\n( PHOTOS: Hillary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life, career)\\nThe White House has its own worries about Messina\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hoped-for move. One is that it would look like Obama was giving his blessing to the pro-Clinton group as his own vice president, Joe Biden, is weighing a 2016 run. Concern within the administration about ruffling relations with Biden has been serious enough to cause a lengthy delay in signing off on Messina officially joining Priorities, according to two people familiar with the deliberations.\\nWhatever role Messina may end up playing in 2016, the mere fact that most Clinton allies are fine with him being part of a pro-Clinton group signals a rapprochement that began when Obama tapped Clinton as his top diplomat. Messina had informal discussions with some of her aides after 2012 about his view of modern campaigns, and Bill Clinton has publicly admired his work since developing a connection with him last year.\\nMessina wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the only one affiliated with Obama to join the future Clinton army via Priorities.

      "features:b\"Reaction and analysis on 'America's Election HQ' of the Democratic debate in Milwaukee\\nHillary Clinton launched her harshest attacks yet on Bernie Sanders during their debate Thursday night in Milwaukee, in a clear attempt to define their differences on major issues and win over black voters \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but they had their most heated exchanges over campaign financing, who was the stronger supporter of President Obama \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and who was a friend of Henry Kissinger.\\nThe debate fell at a time when Sanders is trying to build his momentum after his big New Hampshire win, while Clinton is trying to regain hers.\\nAs Sanders pointedly reminded her, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not in the White House yet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut the candidates at times offered a similar message. This was evident as they vociferously called for an overhaul of local police departments that they suggested are unfair to black people.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe need fundamental police reform,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sanders said, adding he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9csick and tired\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of seeing unarmed black people shot by police. He likened heavily equipped police departments to \\xe2\\x80\\x9coccupying armies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nClinton, meanwhile, echoed those themes, joining Sanders in calling for sentencing reform while saying the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9csystemic racism\\xe2\\x80\\x9d goes deeper and must be addressed \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in education, housing and the job market.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we need to root out,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\nThe comments were part of each candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s revived appeal to minority voters, a key voting bloc as the Democratic presidential primary heads to South Carolina.\\nBut even as they stressed those issues, differences were laid bare at the PBS-hosted debate in Milwaukee. And Sanders came prepared to counter Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attacks, showing a feistier side than he did at their last showdown.\\nWhen Clinton used her closing remarks to suggest Sanders was taking shots at President Obama, Sanders called it a \\xe2\\x80\\x9clow blow\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and countered: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne of us ran against Barack Obama. I was not that candidate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nHe even underscored his critique of Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s foreign policy by pointing to a book where Clinton said she was mentored by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sanders said, calling him \\xe2\\x80\\x9cone of the most destructive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d American diplomats.\\nClinton fired back that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe have yet to know\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who Sanders listens to on foreign policy.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, it ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Henry Kissinger,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sanders said.\\nThe two also clashed sharply over Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 high-cost, big-government plans.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are not England. We are not France,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Clinton said.\\nClinton accused Sanders of pushing programs that would grow the federal government by 40 percent. She suggested his health care promises \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccannot be kept \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand will be far more costly than he admits.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe should level with the American people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\nShe also said Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 plans would upend ObamaCare \\xe2\\x80\\x93 though Sanders said he would not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdismantle\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is absolutely inaccurate,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, when she claimed his plans would leave many people worse off.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn my view, health care is a right of all people \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 and I will fight for that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sanders said, adding it would take \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccourage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nClinton also criticized Sanders for voting against a 2007 immigration reform bill backed by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy.\\nSanders explained that the bill had a guest-worker program that progressive groups opposed.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea of what needed to be done,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Clinton said.\\nYet the candidates agreed in their joint criticism of the Obama administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recent deportation raids.\\nSanders, meanwhile, once again hammered Clinton for her Wall Street ties, suggesting the financial sector\\xe2\\x80\\x99s big donations are meant to buy influence.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not insult the intelligence of the American people. People aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t dumb,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sanders said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy in God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions? I guess just for the fun of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThey sparred on the issue as Sanders touted the fact he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe only candidate up here\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who has no super PAC supporting him. A super PAC backing Clinton, he said, recently raised $15 million from Wall Street.\\nClinton countered by noting that Obama took Wall Street donations too, but \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhen it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not in any way imply here that either President Obama or myself would in any way not take on any vested interest,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, calling for more regulation of the financial sector.\\nThe showdown comes as Clinton tries to reset the race, which heads next to Nevada and South Carolina. Her narrow victory in Iowa and resounding defeat in New Hampshire have raised fresh questions about her candidacy, which at one point was seen as a sure thing for the Democratic nomination.\\nPublicly, the Clinton campaign is voicing confidence. The campaign has been refocusing on the battle to lock down minority voter support, asserting that with their help, the former secretary of state can easily make gains against Sanders. But Sanders is at the same time making a bid to expand his own support beyond rural, white voters -- who largely decide Iowa and New Hampshire.\\nWhile the Clinton campaign is banking on minority voters as it heads into South Carolina and other delegate-rich states down the primary calendar, Tuesday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contest exposed serious problems for her. She lost in New Hampshire across almost every demographic, including women.\\nOverall, she lost to Sanders by more than 20 points.\" target:1\n",
      "features:b'It took years until the executive summary of the Senate Intelligence Committee\\'s torture report \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which shows not only that the CIA\\'s torture regime was larger and more vicious than understood, but that the agency repeatedly lied about it to the White House and Congress \\xe2\\x80\\x94 was finally released to the public. But it only took hours before President Obama was once again urging the nation to look forward, not back. \"Rather than another reason to refight old arguments,\" read a White House statement, \"I hope that today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s report can help us leave these techniques where they belong \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in the past.\" When members of the media asked whether that meant the White House considered torture to be ineffective, as the report claims, an anonymous official said Obama would not \"engage\" in the ongoing \"debate.\" On the issues of rape, waterboarding and induced hypothermia, apparently, reasonable minds can differ.\\nGlenn Greenwald, the Intercept\\'s Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and longtime critic of the war on terror, disagrees. \"There\\'s no debate,\" he told Salon. \"Everything that we did,\" he continued, \"in terms of how we treated detainees, has [long] been viewed as morally vile and inexcusable and criminal.\" Greenwald has little doubt, however, that Washington will turn torture into yet another partisan squabble. It\\'s the go-to move, he says, when America\\'s political and media elite decide they\\'d rather look the other way. \"That\\'s just the ritual Washington engages in,\" Greenwald said.\\nSpeaking with Salon from his home in Brazil (or at least we assumed as much, given the barking in the background) Greenwald discussed what surprised him about the summary, what we still don\\'t know, why expressions of shock and horror from Congress are disingenuous, how President Obama is culpable, too, and why America\\'s leaders are \"sociopathic.\" Our conversation is below and has been edited for clarity and length.\\nOne thing I want to establish as much as we can is who was involved in the lead-up to this release, and what role they played. So why did it take so long for this to be released?\\nWell, first of all, there was a major war between the Senate [Intelligence] Committee and the CIA over access to the information [the committee] wanted. That took years.\\nSecondly, there was a huge conflict between the committee and the White House, which, on its own, tried to stifle and suppress all kinds of vital material. In fact, there were 9,000 documents that the CIA and the White House \\xe2\\x80\\x94 together, as part of the executive branch \\xe2\\x80\\x94 refused to give to the committee.\\nSo much of it was just grappling over access to information (which is ironic, since this committee is supposed to exercise oversight of the CIA ...)\\nAlso, the material was complicated. There were raw reports from all over the world, and it can take a long time to sort through that and put together a comprehensive report. So, I don\\'t think it\\'s surprising that it took this long.\\nAnd did anything in the summary surprise you? Or was it more or less what you expected after covering this for so many years?\\nHonestly, there wasn\\'t really anything that surprised me in terms of the disclosures.\\nThere\\'s obviously new details about some of the more brutal interrogations; there are details and lots of corroborating pieces of evidence about the extent to which the CIA just outright lied, publicly, and to Congress. Part of what surprised me was how overt and unflinching the report was about essentially accusing people like [former CIA head] Gen. Hayden of being pathological liars.\\nBut the broad strokes of the program and what the CIA did have long been known \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for years \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and I think what was more important about Tuesday was the ritual of official Washington finally admitting it.\\nYeah, what\\'s striking to me about the lying is just how clearly it shows that the CIA in many ways is operating outside the system of democratic accountability. It\\'d be wrong to say it\\'s like the CIA runs the country, since there\\'s a bunch of stuff they don\\'t really care about besides intelligence and so forth, but it certainly looks like they don\\'t really answer to anyone.\\nThe CIA cares about a lot more than just intelligence. They care a lot about private contracts (because so many of their colleagues work at those very lucrative private contracting jobs where a lot of them hope to go when they leave the CIA); they care about militarism and the assertion of force in the world (they run the drone program); they do all kinds of military activities beyond just the gather of intelligence. But you\\'re obviously right that the CIA exists beyond democratic accountability \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and has for decades.\\nIf I had to identify one key point from Tuesday, the thing that bothered me most about the narrative: Yes, the CIA goes off on its own and does things that political officials don\\'t know about; and yes, they mislead and lie to the committees that oversee them; and they do all these horrible things, the details of which are sometimes unknown to the political branches \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but that\\'s how Washington wants it.\\nThey\\'ve always wanted it that way. That\\'s what the CIA does. The CIA does the dirty work of the political branches of Washington and when they get caught, publicly, the ritual is that official Washington pretends that it was just these rogue CIA officers doing this without anyone\\'s knowledge or approval. It\\'s exactly what happened in the Iran-Contra scandal, which was ordered at the highest levels of the White House by President Reagan ... but when they got caught, they said: Oh, it was Oliver North and these rogue CIA officers who were doing this without our knowledge!\\nThat\\'s just the ritual Washington engages in; the CIA is kind of like their wild pit bull that they purposely let off leash. They don\\'t want to see the mauling but they know that it\\'s happening, and pretend they don\\'t know. And when it gets reported, they pretend that they\\'re horrified.\\nAlong those lines, I saw a lot of people on Tuesday respond with a kind of amazement at how little President Bush knew about the program, according to the report. But that\\'s not really so weird when you remember that Cheney and Rumsfeld were his top advisers, and that the main lesson they learned from their time in the Nixon administration and from Watergate was to insulate the president from this kind of dirty work as much as possible \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nRight, Watergate and Iran-Contra. Remember: Dick Cheney wrote the dissenting minority report of the House investigation of Iran-Contra, in which he basically laid out his vision for this unilateral presidency.\\nBut I think it goes way beyond that. I actually went back and read a lot of the stuff I wrote about torture in 2006, eight years ago, especially surrounding the Military Commissions Act that passed in October of that year by a large, bipartisan majority in Congress \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the primary purpose of which was to endorse what was happening at Guant\\xc3\\xa1namo with military commissions and to protect torturers from liability for violating the Geneva Conventions \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and it was incredibly clear then that there was a systematic and savage regime of torture that had been implemented.\\nThe American media largely acquiesced to it, and leading members of both parties more or less just kind of went along with it. And that\\'s what\\'s so bothersome about the reaction on Tuesday: Everybody\\'s noses got rubbed in [the torture program] by this report, so people couldn\\'t pretend it wasn\\'t there any longer, they were forced to admit it, but a lot of the outrage and shock is very artificial. It\\'s really just a self-serving reaction designed to erase their own culpability.\\nThe more you look at just how many people and institutions were involved (either actively or by looking the other way) \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the doctors, the psychiatrists, the media, members of Congress \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the more it starts to sound like a society-wide failure. It reminds me of what Arendt wrote about Germany (and Europe in general) in the interwar and World War II periods, how she described it as a kind of civilizational collapse. Tell me if you think I\\'m going too far.\\nI think there are several similar dynamics. For one thing, after World War II, when the full history got told, lots of people who had every way to know what was happening under their noses pretended they didn\\'t because the recognition of their complicity was just too painful. So they denied it and pretended they didn\\'t know and claimed that, had they known, they would have reacted a lot more strongly. That reminds me a lot of Tuesday\\'s reaction on the part of political and media circles in the United States.\\nAnd I also agree with your observation that the way in which values get jettisoned and standards get violated is incremental. It\\'s the frog in the boiling pot analogy; it just incrementally and slowly but inexorably keeps moving away from this point where you think you\\'re at [vis-\\xc3\\xa0-vis norms and values], but because it\\'s incremental you feel like you\\'re always close enough to the prior point that you don\\'t actually feel like it\\'s a radical departure. And that has been the story of the United States not just under the Bush administration but for the last 13 years, where everything that happens that seems shocking becomes the justification for the next step.\\nSo what do we still not know, now that this summary is released?\\nIt\\'s hard to know because we only have seen 600 pages of a 6,000-page report. Presumably there are a lot more details; and, really, what\\'s harrowing are the details. It\\'s reading the specific treatment to which helpless detainees in American custody were subjected that is so disturbing. And so there are a lot of facts like that that are still suppressed, there are facts about who was complicit \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and at some point that full report has to be disclosed.\\nTo your point about the horrible details, as well as how people don\\'t want to look directly at these crimes because their own complicity is so painful: The detail I found the most disturbing in the whole report was about Abu Zubaydah and how he was literally trained to get himself in position for more waterboarding. To me, that is the most horrifying thing in here, that is truly staring-into-the-abyss-level evil; and if I\\'m writing the news, that\\'s one of the first things I bring up to establish the character of this program. But most American media has focused more on the incidents of sexual assault or beatings \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which are obviously still heinous, but are less of an affront to Americans\\' sense of themselves as inherently noble.\\nThe reason that story is so horrifying is because it\\'s the process of dehumanization. It\\'s literally removing what is human about us. There was a detailed account of what happened in what they called \"the Salt Pit\" \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the prison in Afghanistan, where they literally froze people to death \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and [the report] talked about how visitors to that prison observed it was actually more like a dog kennel than it was a prison where human beings were kept. Whenever anyone would walk by, [the prisoners] would literally quiver, they would jump up out of fear, because they had been so conditioned to expect extreme levels of punishment.\\nPsychological torture is, [it\\'s believed] pretty much by consensus, worse than physical torture if it\\'s done at an extreme level. John McCain said that for him, by far, the worst part of captivity in North Vietnam was the isolation and the psychological torment \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not the physical torture to which he was subjected quite extensively. There are studies about how people go insane if they\\'re kept in solitary confinement in American prisons in a way that doesn\\'t happen if the soles of your feet are beaten or you\\'re forced into stress-positions. And so much of this [program] was about dehumanization. It had nothing to do with interrogation; it was about exploitation and control. It was about the assertion of power.\\nAnd that\\'s what makes it so evil. Detainees are, by definition, helpless; they\\'re captive. So to completely brutalize them and remove their humanity is really worse than anything you could do to someone physically, including killing them. It\\'s basically like being dead while alive.\\nA lot of people don\\'t know this but one of the most effective torture techniques the Soviets used in the Stalinist era \\xe2\\x80\\x94 especially during the Great Purge \\xe2\\x80\\x94 wasn\\'t some kind of horrific physical abuse or mutilation. It was sleep deprivation.\\nOh, yeah, I\\'ve written about this before. Andrew Sullivan, to his credit, found this Gestapo manual about these interrogation tactics, and the parallels \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you don\\'t even have to search for them, they\\'re just right there for anyone to see. They\\'re obvious and self-evident. And they\\'re not ancillary similarities; they\\'re central. The way they talk about the techniques and the objectives.\\nAnd this is what makes the fact that there\\'s even something called \"the torture debate\" so ridiculous. This debate, quote-unquote, has been settled not for decades but centuries. Everything that we did as part of the war on terror, in terms of how we treated detainees, has [long] been viewed as morally vile and inexcusable and criminal, pretty much across cultural and social lines. (And the United States has prosecuted people as war criminals for doing things we did.)\\nSo it\\'s not even a debate. There\\'s no debate. [The program\\'s] defilement [of the United States] is self-evident and indisputable.\\nWhen I hear people argue against the anti-torture position, like Nicolle Wallace did Tuesday on \"Morning Joe,\" I often want to say, \"Look, your fight\\'s not really with me right now, it\\'s with the Enlightenment.\"\\nExactly. Although, I have to say, one of the benefits of Tuesday, despite all my frustrations with the process, is that it has prevented anybody from denying that America tortured \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and not just in the three cases of waterboarding. It actually has been a disinfectant of that central lie. I mean, for a long time, that was the debate; it wasn\\'t \"Is torture good?\" it was \"These things aren\\'t torture!\" Dick Cheney described [waterboarding] as dunking people\\'s head into water.\\nWhat was really annoying for those of us who were actually [covering] this is that the waterboarding was almost the least of it. It was the easiest case to call torture because there was a whole body of law calling waterboarding torture; but [the larger issue] was the entire regiment of techniques that they were using that clearly constituted torture \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not on dozens or even hundreds but thousands of people, and not just at Guant\\xc3\\xa1namo but around the world. It was a systematic regime of torture, and I think yesterday\\'s report has prevented that from being denied any longer.\\nAnd that\\'s why people like Nicolle Wallace and others are now resorting either to \"Yes, we tortured, and we should have!\" (which I think is a healthy thing to force them to say) or \"Yes, we tortured, and we shouldn\\'t have, but we\\'re still the greatest thing ever to exist.\"\\nI\\'d like to get your response to a couple of things Gen. Hayden said in the Politico interview that came out the day after the summary\\'s release. He didn\\'t say anything particularly new, but what is very clear is that he\\'s leaning heavily on the Department of Justice\\'s decision in 2012 not to prosecute the CIA agents involved in the deaths of two detainees. Does he have a point in saying, well, if this was so bad then how come the DOJ gave it a pass?\\nI don\\'t blame him for making that argument; and it was totally predictable that that argument would be made. That\\'s what made what President Obama did [by not prosecuting torturers] so disgraceful and why he does bear a very significant part of the culpability and why this will be a huge, dark mar on his legacy. It\\'s so predictable that if you prevent not just criminal prosecutions but even civil liability or international investigation for America\\'s torturers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which is exactly what he did; he not only blocked criminal investigations but used the state secrets privilege to prevent civil liability, and then bullied and coerced other countries in Europe not to investigate \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the message that\\'ll be sent is that [torture] is not actually a crime, that it was a policy dispute.\\nAnd, yes, he is on the other side of the Republicans in this policy dispute, and he thinks we shouldn\\'t torture \\xe2\\x80\\x94 because it doesn\\'t work, because it\\'s inefficient, because it\\'s contrary to our values \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and Republicans can believe it should. But this was never a policy dispute; these are war crimes, among the most atrocious war crimes. And when the Justice Department decides that nobody should pay any price, legally, for what was done, the message President Obama sent was: At worst, this is just a policy error. So of course people like Dick Cheney and Michael Hayden are going to say, well, if we\\'re really such brutal war criminals, why aren\\'t we being prosecuted?\\nI tried to get at this in a recent piece but one of the consequences of having torture now be a policy dispute is that all this talk of the report chronicling a dark chapter in our history and so forth is misleading, because it\\'s not like the torture era has actually ended. It\\'s just on pause, at best.\\nThe United States is still torturing people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and continued to torture people well into the Obama administration. It didn\\'t do it by following legal memos from the Justice Department about these specific techniques, but the abuse of prisoners is well-documented at Bagram, in Iraq and even at Guantanamo. For years after president Obama\\'s inauguration, according to reporting from Jeremy Scahill, there were torture chambers in Somalia.\\nAnd the United States didn\\'t just torture on its own. We sent \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we \"rendered\" \\xe2\\x80\\x94 people to these tyrants that we claim to hate the most now, like Mubarak in Egypt and Assad in Syria and Gadhafi in Libya, in order to be tortured as well. And this has gone on for decades; obviously the CIA has supported all kinds of torturing squads around the world. So torture is a tool that the U.S. government has used pretty openly and continuously for decades \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but especially since the war on terror. And nobody [in Washington] was surprised about learning that on Tuesday, although they pretended to be.\\nThe other thing Hayden said that I\\'d be interested to hear you respond to was a comment that came near the end of the interview, which I guess was kind of darkly funny in a not-funny way. He basically says, If Congress said I lied to them, that\\'s not true, because I was just communicating what subordinates had told me, so it\\'s really their fault. It\\'s like a twisted, reverse Nuremberg defense \\xe2\\x80\\x94 instead of just following orders from above, the claim is that you\\'re just passing along information from below.\\nYou\\'re right entirely in what you just said, but I actually think that that\\'s what people like Sen. Dianne Feinstein are doing as well \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or, for that matter, people in the U.S. media. They\\'re saying, look, we didn\\'t raise alarms about what the CIA was doing and about the torture they were engaging in because they were telling us that it was working, or that it wasn\\'t as brutal as it actually turned out to be. We were just misled. It\\'s exactly what people like Hillary Clinton do to justify their very vocal and public support of the Iraq War ...\\nAt some point, this blame-shifting has to stop. It should become apparent just how deeply corrupt, toxic and sociopathic the Washington political and media class is. I mean, it would be one thing if this was some isolated aberration, but this is a reflection of what the United States government in so many different ways around the world for a long time \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but certainly since the war on terror, when it was intensified. And all of this faux indignation and shock and anger over discovering it is really unconvincing and disingenuous.\\nThe reality is that people were comfortable with this and now all the truth has come out and they\\'re embarrassed about what they\\'ve done. That\\'s what this is about.\\nLast question: What do you think about this idea being floated around that Obama should issue a blanket pardon of torturers before he leaves office? The idea is that a pardon would represent an acknowledgment that laws were broken, which would in turn reestablish the norm of torture as an illegal act?\\nI hate that idea. I mean, I stand second to nobody in my admiration for the ACLU, but I thought the Op-Ed in the New York Times by Anthony Romero advocating that was really unconvincing, to put it generously.\\nFor one thing, the world and certainly the overwhelming majority of the American public views a pardon as an expression of [the belief that] someone is deserving of leniency and protection from punishment \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not as an admission of guilt. The lawyers at the ACLU might understand that a pardon is actually a formal declaration of guilt, but the rest of the world wouldn\\'t see it that way.\\nSecondly, all these people who\\'d get pardoned would have to do is just rhetorically reject the pardon and mock it and say they don\\'t need the pardon because they did nothing criminal. So the whole message would be destroyed anyway, and the only message that would come from it is that the people who tortured are being protected by President Obama from criminal liability (which happens to be the case anyway).\\nAnd thirdly, President Obama would never do it. He\\'s made it completely clear that he won\\'t risk an iota of his political capital in order to enforce U.S. legal obligations and treaty obligations to make clear that torture is a crime. The last time he talked about torture he talked about it like it was just the most casual thing in the world; he said, \"We tortured some folks.\" And then he told us not to be sanctimonious about it because these [torturers] were great patriots who were doing it with good hearts.\\nSo it\\'s an unrealistic proposal and an incredibly unconvincing one.

He\\'s interested in grandstanding and lobbying for more expansive powers in the office he holds.\"\\nWalters\\' statement came in response to a Times interview with Shaub in which he criticized the administration\\'s handling of ethics guidelines and made a laundry list of new proposals he recommends the government takes to help limit and handle ethical snafus.\\nShaub said the administration has made the US \"pretty close to a laughingstock at this point.\"\\n\"It\\'s hard for the United States to pursue international anticorruption and ethics initiatives when we\\'re not even keeping our own side of the street clean,\" Shaub told the Times. \"It affects our credibility. ... I think we are pretty close to a laughingstock at this point.\"\\nShaub was particularly critical of President Donald Trump\\'s constant weekend trips to his clubs and golf courses. Just this past weekend, Trump attended the US Women\\'s Open golf tournament being held at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club. The president repeatedly promoted the event on Twitter while he was in attendance.\\n\"It creates the appearance of profiting from the presidency,\" Shaub said. \"Misuse of position is really the heart of the ethics program, and the internationally accepted definition of corruption is abuse of entrusted power. It undermines the government ethics program by casting doubt on the integrity of government decision making.\"\\nShaub\\'s recommendations included forcing presidential candidates to release their tax returns, providing the OGE with subpoena power, and giving the office additional power when it comes to dealing with presidential conflicts of interest.\\nPrior to Trump, every major party candidate since 1976 released their tax returns. Additionally, the victorious candidates have divested from their holdings. Trump, with holdings that far outpace any president before him, has not, instead allowing his two adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, in addition to a senior Trump Organization employee, to control his assets.\\n\"Other presidents have understood it is a pragmatic necessity,\" Shaub, who is joining the Campaign Legal Center after he leaves office, said. \"This president seems to think it is a perk of high office.\"\\nShaub, who was appointed by President Barack Obama to a five-year term as head of the OGE that began in January of 2013, said he did not want his role to be that of challenging the president.\\n\"I would not have picked this fight,\" he said. \"But I have never been one to shy away from bullies.\"\\nWalter Shaub.AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite\\nShaub announced in a letter to Trump earlier this month that he would resign ahead of the end of his term, which was scheduled to end in January 2018. Shaub\\'s last day is Wednesday.\\nIn an interview with NPR shortly after his announcement, Shaub said \"the current situation has made it clear that the ethics program needs to be stronger than it is. At the Campaign Legal Center, I\\'ll have more freedom to push for reform. I\\'ll also be broadening my focus to include ethics issues at all levels of government.\"\\nShaub has been sharply critical of both Trump and his administration\\'s ethical quandaries during the president\\'s early months in office.\\nThe OGE pushed Trump to fully divest from his businesses ahead of taking office and placing his assets into a blind trust, a move Trump subsequently did not make. Shaub criticized the plan that involved Donald Jr. and Eric during a speech at the Brookings Institution prior to Trump\\'s inauguration, saying it \"doesn\\'t meet the standards that the best of his nominees are meeting and that every president in the past four decades has met.\"\\n\"His sons are still running the businesses, and, of course, he knows what he owns,\" Shaub said.\\nShaub has had a fraught relationship with the administration in the months since.\\nHe battled Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, to release the ethics waivers of White House employees, a move with which the White House later complied after initially stonewalling. The release of the waivers showed that several top White House officials, such as counselor Kellyanne Conway and chief strategist Steve Bannon, received ethics waivers for certain areas.\\nShaub was later critical of Bannon\\'s waiver, calling it \"problematic.\"' target:0\n",
      "features:b'WASHINGTON (AP) \\xe2\\x80\\x94 The U.S. lost 33,000 jobs in September after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hit Texas, Florida and other Southeastern states. It was the first decline in nearly seven years.\\nThe unemployment rate fell to 4.2 percent from 4.4 percent, the Labor Department said Friday, the lowest level since February 2001.\\nLooking past the hurricanes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 impact, the job market and economy generally look healthy. Some economists expect job growth to rebound in the coming months as businesses in the area reopen and construction companies ramp up repair and renovation work.\\nLast month\\xe2\\x80\\x99s drop was driven by huge losses in restaurants and bars, which shed 105,000 jobs, a sign of the damage to Florida\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tourism industry.\\nRoughly 1.5 million people were unable to work last month because of the weather, the government said, the most in 20 years.\\nMore than 11 million people had been employed in the 87 counties in Texas and Florida that were declared disaster areas, the government says. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s equal to about 7.7 percent of the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s workforce. Hourly employees in the area who couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work and missed a paycheck were counted as not working, thereby lowering the September job gain. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true even if those employees return to work after the storm passes.\\nOther recent indicators point to a solid economy and job market.\\nOn Wednesday, a survey of services firms \\xe2\\x80\\x94 covering restaurants, construction companies, retail stores, banks and others \\xe2\\x80\\x94 found that they expanded in September at their fastest monthly pace since 2005. That followed a survey of manufacturers, which found an equally strong gain. Factory activity expanded at the fastest pace in more than 13 years.\\nThere are signs that a rebound from the hurricanes is already boosting the economy. Auto sales, which had been lackluster this year, jumped 6.1 percent to more than 1.5 million in September from a year ago, according to Autodata Corp., as Americans began to replace cars destroyed by the storms. That increase in purchases should soon lead automakers to step up production.\\nHarvey caused about $76 billion to $87 billion in economic losses, according to Moody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Analytics, an economic consulting firm. The estimate includes damage to homes and businesses as well as lost business and economic output. That calculation would make Harvey the second-worst U.S. natural disaster, after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\\nIrma will likely end up having caused $58 billion to $83 billion in economic losses, Moody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forecasts. Maria, which hammered Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, could cost $45 billion to $95 billion, though that is a preliminary estimate.\\n___\\nThis story has been corrected to show that September\\xe2\\x80\\x99s job losses figure was the first decline in nearly seven years.\\nCopyright \\xc2\\xa9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.\\nClick to Read More and View Comments\\nClick to Hide' target:1\n",

Each day, thousands of passengers use the station in the city once called Stalingrad.\\nTwo blasts in two days\\nVideo footage from the scene Monday showed the twisted shell of a blue trolleybus, with debris spread around it.

Russian media reported that a female Islamist suicide bomber from the Russian region of Dagestan was responsible for that attack.\\n\"Most of the militants responsible for terrorist attacks in Russia over the last decade -- including female suicide bombers who have taken part in 20 attacks claiming at least 780 lives since June 2000 -- have come from Dagestan,\" RIA Novosti reported Monday.\\nThe two young men behind the Boston Marathon bombings lived briefly in Dagestan before coming to the United States, and one of them visited the area the year before the attack.\\n\"Radical Islamist groups tied to the war against the Russian state now have much deeper roots, and are far more active, in Dagestan than in Chechnya,\" Rajan Menon, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, wrote in a CNN.com column.\\nWhat might be behind the attacks?\\nPutin has maintained that the Sochi games will be safe and security will be tight. Visitors to Sochi and the surrounding area are subjected to rigorous security checks, and vehicle license plates are monitored.\\n\"This will probably be one of the most difficult Olympics to actually go as a spectator and watch the Games because of the myriad layers of security,\" Republican Rep. Michael Grimm of New York told CNN on Monday.\\nOther parts of Russia\\nHowever, the Volgograd explosions showed the challenge that Russian authorities face in policing the rest of the country amid ongoing unrest in the North Caucasus. That region includes Chechnya, where Russia fought two wars against separatist movements, and Dagestan.\\nWith tight security around Sochi itself, terrorists are believed to be focusing on other parts of the North Caucasus and southern Russia.\\nRIA Novosti reported a car bomb killed three people on Friday in Pyatigorsk in southern Russia, about 160 miles (270 kilometers) east of Sochi.\\n\"Rarely do you actually have a terrorist group come out and say, \\'We\\'re going to try and disrupt these games,\\'\" CNN national security analyst Fran Townsend said Monday. \"When al Qaeda-related affinity groups make these sort of statements, you\\'ve got to take them at their word.\"\\nThe fact that the bombers are targeting transportation is \"not lost on Olympic Committee organizers and security officials,\" she added.\\nAthletes are \"most vulnerable\" when moving between the Olympic Village and the sites of their events, she said.\\nTownsend, who coordinated with Greek officials before the Olympics in Athens in 2004, said security officials all over the world will be asking Russia for detailed information about these attacks, including whether there were any indications or warnings.\\nThey\\'ll also ask about what information Russian intelligence has on the capabilities of terrorist groups to pull off further attacks.' target:-1\n",
      "features:b'Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. Charles Dharapak/AP Photo\\nLittle is known about when, exactly, the \"sequester\" will wreak its expected havoc on the nation - but the process begins on Friday.\\nEach federal agency will implement its cuts differently, on its own timeline, and the White House Office of Management and Budget tells ABC News it does not have a calendar for what cuts will happen when.\\nThe soonest-felt cuts will be to civilians working for federal contractors, who have been squeezed since late last year. Layoffs could happen right away, and President Obama will travel to a shipyard in Virginia today to highlight those cuts.\\nBut we can guess that some of the worst purported consequences - of which agency heads have warned repeatedly - will come as a result of furloughs for government workers. Mandatory days off for TSA agents and air-traffic controllers will mean logjammed air travel, and fewer border patrol agents on duty will mean a more porous border, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano have said. Those furloughs will begin in April.\\nWith that in mind, here\\'s a basic timeline:\\nMarch 1 - Sequestration goes into effect. Barring a large deficit-reduction deal, or an agreement to cancel the sequester altogether, President Obama will be required to issue a sequestration order before midnight on March 1. His Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will submit a report to Congress. Federal agencies, which have already been drafting their sequestration plans according to OMB, will begin operating at reduced funding levels. The cuts will happen.\\n~March 4 - Furlough notices issued. If President Obama gives his order late at night on Friday, March 1, agencies could give notice to employees on the following Monday, March 4, that furloughs will be coming. Furloughed employees must be notified a month in advance, in most cases, according to Office of Personnel Management guidelines. Agencies can issue these notices before March 1, so it\\'s possible federal employees will get word of furloughs this week. Agencies could also wait to issue furlough notices, hoping that a deficit deal comes quickly.\\nMarch 27 - The government runs out of money, or a new funding measure is passed. The federal government is currently being funded by a temporary measure that expires March 27. Congress and Obama will have to approve more funding in March, and while they\\'ve previously opted to continue the same funding levels, the March 27 deadline could provide a convenient time for them to strike a deficit deal, or at least modify the sequestration law to target the cuts differently.\\n~April 4 - Furloughs can begin, consequences are felt. This date is not definite, but it\\'s a best guess. A wide array of agency-specific factors could mean different kinds of federal workers are furloughed at different times, according to an OMB official, but a 30-day notification timeline is the general rule - meaning government employees would start missing work a month after notices go out March 4.\\nIt\\'s not as if the entire federal government will shut its doors. Many furloughed employees will miss one day every two weeks - the Federal Aviation Administration, for instance, plans on cutting its workforce by that amount. But if the heads of federal agencies are to be believed - and hyperbole is possible - Americans can expect longer waits in the TSA line, fewer commercial flights, a more porous border, fewer workplace inspections, less meat and poultry production, and a host of miserable consequences arising from furloughed TSA workers, air traffic controlers, border-patrol agents, and OSHA and FDA inspectors.\\nAgain, it\\'s not certain that these purported consequences will begin happening April 4. Agencies have developed their own plans for implementing sequester cuts, and the timing could be different where different parts of the federal government are concerned. If any agencies have graded out their sequester plans, counting on Obama and Congress to reach a deficit bargain within a few weeks of the sequestration era, the worst of the cuts could be delayed.' target:-1\n",

      "features:b'Conservatives and the Never Trump movement are discouraged and rightfully so. Despite 60 percent of Republicans voting against Donald Trump this primary season, he is now the presumptive GOP nominee. A plurality of the voters have essentially allowed a stranger in our house.\\nThe problem of conservatives staying home on Election Day is something that needs to be reversed. If it is not, Republicans will likely lose not just the White House but their majority in the Senate. Their fight to hold it is an uphill battle already, but conservatives staying home would result in a Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Already at risk are incumbents Kelly Ayotte, Mark Kirk, Ron Johnson, Rob Portman, Pat Toomey, Roy Blunt and John McCain, as well as the seat being vacated by Marco Rubio.\\nThere are three ways to avoid conservatives being disenfranchised and not participating in November. First, the delegates at the Republican National Convention could stage some sort of coup that sees Trump lose the nomination. But this is not going to happen. Republicans are resigned to Trump as the nominee and delegates won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t rock the boat.\\nNext, Trump finds a way to connect with and energize those on the legions on the right that say they will not vote for him. His relationship with conservatives has always been tenuous. Trump has had more positions on conservative issues than there are in the Kama Sutra. From four different positions on abortion in less than four days to not being willing to raise the Social Security retirement age to even pushing for the individual mandate. He has said he hates Obamacare, but he wants to just replace it with a better version of it\\xe2\\x80\\x94of course, Trump says he will do so by making \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreat deals.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nReconciliation is a long shot. It seems clear that the division within the Republican Party is vast and will not be repaired until, at the very earliest, after the election. Trump unifying the GOP is as likely as my going on a date with Jennifer Lawrence.\\nThis leaves us with the third option: a viable third-party presidential candidate whom conservatives would be excited about. Were a Ben Sasse, Tom Coburn, James Mattis (who already declined once), even a Mitt Romney or other conservative would improve the odds for many Senate Republicans just by energizing the conservative base. Without this viable third-party candidate, House and Senate Republicans are going to lose.\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not kid ourselves; we conservatives hold no illusion that a third-party candidate would be able to capture the 270 electoral votes required to win the presidency. The best this candidate could hope for would be no candidate hitting 270 and the election going to the House of Representatives, where skillful lobbying would secure the presidency. But the chances that the election turns to the House are minimal. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re probably looking at President Hillary Clinton, and we know it.\\nBeing the viable third-party presidential contender is a suicide mission of sorts. It is a form of self-sacrifice that demonstrates a willingness to endure the hardships of the campaign trail. Granted, it could also be argued that it is a sign of stupidity. From endless fundraisers and rubber chicken dinners to having every facet of your life picked apart by opponents and the press, it is not an enjoyable experience. In fact, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s likely that what you will be remembered for will be some flaw that was exposed. Just ask Rick \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOops\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Perry, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLyin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Ted\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cruz, John \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFlip Flop\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Kerry, Michael \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWillie Horton\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dukakis, and numerous others.\\nIf and when Trump loses in November, this third-party candidate would be scapegoated by Trump supporters as the reason that Trump lost. It would be pure fiction, as Trump will be the reason for his own loss. The misogyny, the xenophobia, the childish insults, the utter lack of actual policy and the paucity of understanding of the issues will be his downfall. Voters already know who Trump is and what he represents. Given the level of fanatical zeal with which Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supporters attack opponents, especially online, this third-party candidate will face a vicious amount of backlash and harassment.\\nHowever, this candidate would be fondly remembered in conservative circles. After the general election, the Republican Party will begin to rebuild. The third-party candidate who ran to save vulnerable House and Senate Republicans would be an immediate leader whose voice would carry weight. On top of this, he or she would have endeared themself to these vulnerable Republicans whom they ran to save. Their campaign will have the benefit of being creating a lot of IOUs.\\nConservative leaders have soul searching to do and conversations to have. They know that Donald Trump is imperiling Republican majorities in the House and Senate. They know that they need to coalesce behind a viable third-party candidate whose campaign would energize the depressed conservative base and ensure they vote to save vulnerable Republicans in November. They know that it is not too late to beat back the Trumpkins and give conservatives an energy boost that would have them out on the front lines fighting to save GOP candidates over the next six months.\\nThe ball is in the court of Sen. Sasse, Gov. Romney, Gov. Haley, Sen. Coburn and others. Who is going to pick it up and run with it?' target:-1\n",

      "features:b'BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Hungary on Tuesday declared a state of emergency in two of its southeastern counties in response to the migration crisis, a move that paves the way to deploy the army to the border with Serbia to stop the flow of migrants that has been entering the country.\\nThe state of emergency gives authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to shut down roads and limit the working of public institutions. It also speeds up court processes for asylum-seekers.\\nTechnically, parliament must still approve the deployment of the military. However, Associated Press reporters at the border have already spotted heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs at the border in recent days.\\nThe announcement on the state of emergency comes as tougher laws also came into effect on Tuesday aimed at preventing asylum-seekers from entering the country. The legislation makes it a crime to try to breach a razor-wire fence along the border with Serbia and also includes longer prison terms for convicted human traffickers.\\nHungarian officials closed two of seven border crossings with Serbia Tuesday morning. The night before, officials deployed a boxcar covered with razor wire to close a key border crossing along a railroad track that had been the main entry point for migrants.\\nThere were chaotic scenes at the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, as the Hungarians opened a small temporary office to process people on the edge of no man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s land and crowds tried to squeeze inside. A first group of about 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.\\nA group of migrants also blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary, saying they will refuse food and water until they are allowed to cross into Hungary. The sit-in protest is happening on the no man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s land between Roszke and Horgos, Serbia, which is the main border crossing between the two countries.\\nThose who were lucky enough to make it into Hungary the day before were boarding buses. One Hungarian police officer said they were being sent directly to Austria.\\nPeople had dashed to make it into the country in recent days, hoping to reach Western Europe before it was too late.

      "features:b'WASHINGTON (AP) \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Conservatives are praising the Trump administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rollback of public school bathroom requirements for transgender students, saying the move corrects a legal overreach by the Obama administration that is best left for states to decide. Transgender rights advocates, meanwhile, are vowing to overcome a major setback.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not discouraged. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to keep fighting like we have been and keep fighting for the right thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gavin Grimm, a transgender teen who sued his Virginia high school over its bathroom access policy and whose case is set to be heard by the Supreme Court next month.\\nThe Justice and Education departments said Wednesday that public schools no longer need to abide by the Obama-era directive instructing them to allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms of their chosen gender. That guidance, issued in May, led to a spate of lawsuits over how it should be applied, according to a letter from the departments being sent to schools nationwide.\\nThe agencies said they withdrew the guidance to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin order to further and more completely consider the legal issues involved.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAnti-bullying safeguards for students will not be affected by the change, according to the letter. But advocates of protections for transgender teens said the overall rollback sends \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca message that something is wrong with them, which is harmful,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Nancy Haque, co-executive director of Basic Rights Oregon.\\nGrimm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case also could be in jeopardy with the guidance now lifted. The high court could decide not to hear it and direct lower courts to settle that issue instead.\\nThere won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be any immediate impact on schools, because the Obama guidance had been temporarily blocked since August by a federal judge in Texas, one of 13 states that sued over the directive. And schools remain free to provide the same treatment to students even without guidance.\\nThe earlier guidance was based on the Obama administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s determination that federal sex discrimination law known as Title IX, applies to gender identity. It will now be up to states and school districts to decide the issue of bathroom access.\\nThe Obama guidance did not sufficiently explain its interpretation of that law, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCongress, state legislatures and local governments are in a position to adopt appropriate policies or laws addressing this issue,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sessions said, adding that the department is still committed to protecting students from bullying.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is an issue best solved at the state and local level,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Education Secretary Betsy DeVos added. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSchools, communities and families can find \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and in many cases have found \\xe2\\x80\\x94 solutions that protect all students.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nEarlier Wednesday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer denied media reports that DeVos, who has been criticized for her stance on LGBT issues, had opposed the change but was overruled by Sessions. Spicer said any disagreement was merely over wording and timing.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is no daylight between anybody,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Spicer said, adding that DeVos was \\xe2\\x80\\x9c100 percent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on board with the decision.\\nConservative activists who saw it as the Obama administration meddling in local matters praised the change. Wisconsin state Rep. Jesse Kremer said he was pleased by the change but still intends to re-introduce a bill to force public school students to use bathrooms that correspond with their birth gender.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo longer will federal officials distort federal law that is meant to equalize educational opportunities for women, and no longer will they force local officials to intermingle boys and girls within private areas like locker rooms, showers, hotel rooms on school trips and restrooms,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gary McCaleb, senior counsel for the conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom.\\nHowever, the reversal is a setback for transgender rights groups, which had been urging Trump to keep the guidelines in place. Advocates say federal law will still prohibit discrimination against students based on their gender or sexual orientation. But, they said, lifting the guidance puts children in harm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s way.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe mother lions in this country are not going to let anything go backward in transgender equality because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been very hard fought,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Linda Fishbaugh, the mother of a transgender New Hampshire teenager.\\nA patchwork of state laws could continue to emerge as a result of the change. Fifteen states have explicit protections for transgender students in their state laws, and many individual school districts in other states have adopted policies that cover such students on the basis of their gender identity, said Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Human Rights Campaign. Just one state, North Carolina, has enacted a law restricting access to bathrooms in government-owned buildings to the sex that appears on a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s birth certificate. Lawmakers in more than 10 states are considering similar legislation, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\\n__\\nAssociated Press writers Ben Finley in Norfolk, Virginia, Todd Richmond in Madison, Wisconsin, and Steven Dubois in Portland, Oregon, contributed to this report.' target:1\n",

      "features:b'President Donald Trump is getting frustrated with his administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own demands for border wall funding.\\nIn a private meeting regarding the wall Monday, Trump fumed at senators and his own staff about the $1.6 billion the Senate is planning to send him this fall, according to two people familiar with the meeting. Trump wants the full $25 billion upfront and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand why Congress is going to supply him funds in a piecemeal fashion \\xe2\\x80\\x94 even though that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how the spending process typically works.\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s focused on border security. And like all presidents, he wants it done now. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re part of the legislative process. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s slower and deliberate,\" said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), who met with Trump.\\nThe president said at the meeting that if Congress doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give him the resources he needs for border security, he will shut down the government in September, according to one of the people familiar with the meeting. He did not give a specific number, but has been fixated on getting the $25 billion in a lump sum.\\nIn fact, the $1.6 billion figure came from Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, who attended the meeting. Mulvaney submitted the request to Congress earlier this year, though the administration has since upped its ask to $2.2 billion.\\nSenate Democrats offered to provide $25 billion in border wall funding earlier this year in return for giving 1.8 million young undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship. But Trump and most Republicans rebuffed that proposal to salvage the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Democrats are unlikely to provide $25 billion for Trump\\'s wall absent a much broader immigration deal.\\nTrump\\'s renewed focus on the border wall comes amid rising pressure to end his administration\\'s policy of separating families that cross the border illegally. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9czero tolerance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d policy shift has been roundly criticized by lawmakers in both parties, but Trump has blamed Congress for inaction on immigration.\\n\"Now is the best opportunity ever for Congress to change the ridiculous and obsolete laws on immigration. Get it done, always keeping in mind that we must have strong border security,\" Trump tweeted on Tuesday morning.\\nGOP lawmakers are loath to see a government shutdown on their watch just weeks before the midterm elections.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably an overwhelming belief in the House and the Senate, especially the Senate, that government shutdowns aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t good for anybody,\" Shelby said.\\nThe Appropriations Committee began working to pass its Homeland Security bill on Tuesday. Democrats seem unlikely to change course and agree to add more border security money for the president.\\n\"We\\'ve got the bill and we\\'re moving forward and I think we\\'re going to get good bipartisan support for it. I think it\\'s a good bill that will keep our borders safe,\" said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), ranking member of the Homeland Security appropriations committee.\\nOn Monday, GOP Sens. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Shelby both tried to explain to Trump that the Senate is merely meeting Mulvaney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s request and has to cut a bipartisan deal with Democrats. The Senate needs 60 votes to pass a spending bill, so Republicans would have to find at least nine Democratic votes.\\n\"We\\'re going to make a down payment on that working together,\" said Capito, chairwoman of Homeland Security spending panel.\\nBut Trump has not been mollified. He raised his voice several times in Monday\\'s meeting with Mulvaney, White House staffers and the senators, insisting he needs the full $25 billion \\xe2\\x80\\x94 an unlikely outcome in the narrowly divided Senate.\\nShelby said he views $1.6 billion as a floor in negotiations, which could increase if Democrats want to do some horse-trading.' target:-1\n",
